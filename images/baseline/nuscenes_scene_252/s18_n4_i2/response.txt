### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1:**
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Adjacent left lane
   - Movement: Moving parallel to ego, slightly ahead, maintaining a constant speed.

2. **Object ID 2:**
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crosswalk ahead
   - Movement: Stationary, waiting to cross.

3. **Object ID 3:**
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead, controlling the intersection ahead
   - Status: Green

4. **Object ID 4:**
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same lane as ego, approximately 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving forward at a slightly slower speed than ego.

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, indicating that the ego vehicle can proceed forward.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing slightly over the past 4 seconds, from 5.99 m/s to 4.94 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The acceleration has varied, with a peak of 1.08 m/s² and a current value of 0.27 m/s².
- **Turn Angle:** The turn angle has been minor, indicating slight adjustments to the left and right, with the current angle at 1.52 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward, maintaining a constant speed. It will monitor the vehicle ahead and maintain a safe following distance. The pedestrian at the crosswalk is stationary and does not currently require stopping. The green traffic light allows for continued movement.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 5.0 m/s to maintain a constant speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for balanced control.
