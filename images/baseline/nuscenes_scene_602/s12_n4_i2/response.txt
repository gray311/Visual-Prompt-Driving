### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Adjacent lane to the left
   - Movement: Moving parallel to ego, slightly ahead

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crosswalk ahead
   - Movement: Stationary, waiting to cross

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead, controlling intersection ahead
   - State: Green

4. **Object ID 4**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same lane as ego, 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Slowing down

#### Traffic Light:
- **State**: Green
- **Action**: Proceed forward

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreased from 2.66 m/s to 0.03 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Varied, with a significant drop in the last second.
- **Turn Angle**: Increased significantly, indicating a recent turn.
- **Behavior**: Ego vehicle has recently completed a turn and is almost at a stop.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- **Plan**: The ego vehicle should proceed forward, accelerating to match the flow of traffic. Maintain awareness of the vehicle ahead and be prepared to decelerate if it continues to slow down. Ensure a safe following distance and be cautious of the pedestrian at the crosswalk.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize achieving the desired speed quickly after the recent turn.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 to allow for smooth acceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 3.0 m/s to match the flow of traffic.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should proceed straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 to ensure smooth control while maintaining the desired direction.
