### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Position: 8 meters ahead in the same lane
   - Movement: Moving forward at a similar speed to ego

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Position: 5 meters to the right, on the sidewalk
   - Movement: Stationary

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Position: 10 meters ahead
   - State: Green

4. **Object ID 4**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Position: 6 meters behind in the same lane
   - Movement: Approaching ego at a higher speed

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light ahead is green, so we can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has fluctuated slightly but remains low, indicating cautious driving.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has increased over the last 4 seconds, suggesting the ego vehicle is trying to gain speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has increased slightly, indicating a slight leftward adjustment over time.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward, accelerating to match the flow of traffic. There are no immediate obstacles or red lights, and the pedestrian is safely on the sidewalk. The vehicle behind is approaching, so maintaining a steady speed and accelerating slightly will help avoid any potential rear-end collision.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize reaching and maintaining the desired speed quickly.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for a balance between smooth control and responsiveness.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 2.0 m/s to match the flow of traffic and avoid being rear-ended.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as we are moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
