### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1 (Vehicle)**:
   - Lane: Same lane as ego.
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead.
   - Movement: Moving forward at a constant speed.

2. **Object ID 2 (Pedestrian)**:
   - Lane: Crossing the road from the left.
   - Distance: 6 meters ahead.
   - Movement: Moving slowly across the road.

3. **Object ID 3 (Traffic Light)**:
   - State: Green.
   - Distance: 10 meters ahead.

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, so proceed forward.

#### Ego Analysis:
- Over the last 4 seconds, the ego vehicle has been accelerating and turning to the right.
- Current speed is 2.22 m/s, and the turn angle has increased significantly, indicating a right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed.
- Monitor the pedestrian crossing the road and be prepared to decelerate if necessary to avoid collision.
- Follow the green traffic light and proceed with caution.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smoother control while moving forward.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 2.5 m/s to maintain a safe and steady pace.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving forward without turning.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control during forward movement.
