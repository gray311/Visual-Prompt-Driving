### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving forward at a similar speed

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing from left to right, 6 meters ahead
   - Movement: Walking at a moderate pace

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead, 10 meters ahead
   - State: Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, indicating that the ego vehicle can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively stable, with a slight decrease from 4.77 m/s to 4.58 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been minimal, indicating a steady pace.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been minimal, indicating the vehicle is moving straight with slight adjustments.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed, maintaining awareness of the pedestrian crossing ahead and the vehicle in the same lane. The green traffic light allows for continued movement without stopping.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a steady speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.5 m/s to maintain a steady pace.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
