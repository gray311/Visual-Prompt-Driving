### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same lane as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving forward at a constant speed

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing the road from left to right
   - Distance: 6 meters ahead
   - Movement: Walking across the lane

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead
   - State: Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, indicating that the ego vehicle can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- Over the last 4 seconds, the ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly from a standstill (0.0 m/s to 0.29 m/s).
- The turn angle has been minimal, indicating a mostly straight path with a slight right turn recently (0.19 degrees).
- The ego vehicle needs to be cautious of the pedestrian crossing the road and the vehicle ahead.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION (due to pedestrian crossing)

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward but decelerate to avoid collision with the pedestrian crossing the road.
- Maintain awareness of the vehicle ahead and adjust speed to ensure a safe following distance.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 4,
  "desired_speed": 1.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a desired speed quickly after deceleration.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for a balanced response to control inputs.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 4 to ensure a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 1.0 m/s to proceed cautiously due to the pedestrian.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control while maintaining the lane.
