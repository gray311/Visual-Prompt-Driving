### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Bus (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, stationary.
   - Movement: No movement detected in the past 4 seconds.

2. **Pedestrians (ID: 2, 3)**:
   - Lane: Sidewalk, not in the driving lane.
   - Movement: Walking along the sidewalk, no immediate impact on driving.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with slight variations around 9 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been decreasing, indicating a slight deceleration trend.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been consistent, indicating the vehicle is maintaining a steady course.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed. The bus on the right lane is stationary and does not pose an immediate threat. Pedestrians are on the sidewalk and do not require any immediate action. Maintain awareness of the surroundings and be prepared to adjust if the bus starts moving or if pedestrians enter the road.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 9.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 9.0 m/s to match the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
