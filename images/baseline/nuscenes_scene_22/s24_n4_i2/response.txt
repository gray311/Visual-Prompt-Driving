### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Bus (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Right side, partially on the road.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate threat as it is parked off the main driving lane.

2. **Motorcycle (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: Right side, near the curb.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate threat as it is parked off the main driving lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the images.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing slightly from 9.0 m/s to 8.59 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Slight increase in acceleration from 0.35 m/s² to 0.51 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly decreasing from 9.17 degrees to 8.94 degrees, indicating a slight rightward adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed, maintaining awareness of the parked bus and motorcycle on the right side. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop or significant speed adjustment.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.6,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a steady speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 8.6 m/s to match the current speed trend.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 2 for balanced control.
