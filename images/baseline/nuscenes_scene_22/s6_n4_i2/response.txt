### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects**:
  - **Bus**: Located in the right lane, approximately 10 meters ahead.
  - **Trees**: Positioned along both sides of the road, not obstructing the lane.
  - **Buildings**: On the right side, not affecting the lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 5.41 m/s to 6.89 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Generally positive, indicating an increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Decreasing from 13.89° to 9.75°, suggesting a slight rightward adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed.
- Be cautious of the bus ahead and maintain a safe distance.
- No need for lane changes or stops as the path is clear.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 6.89,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 6.89 m/s, matching the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the bus ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
