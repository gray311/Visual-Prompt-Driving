### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Vehicle (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a steady speed.
   - Distance: Approximately 10 meters ahead of the ego vehicle.

2. **Pedestrian (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: On the sidewalk to the left of the ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Walking along the sidewalk, not entering the road.

3. **Parked Vehicles (ID: 3, 4, 5)**:
   - Lane: Parked on the right side of the road.
   - Movement: Stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (from 7.81 m/s to 5.33 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating a slight increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight adjustments, indicating minor steering corrections.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop. The pedestrian is on the sidewalk and does not pose a threat. The parked vehicles on the right are stationary and do not interfere with the ego vehicle's path.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 7.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (Moderate importance to maintain desired speed).
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (Low control effort for smooth acceleration).
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (Moderate importance to maintain safe distance).
- **Desired Speed**: 7.0 m/s (Target speed to maintain a safe following distance).
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds (Safe following distance).
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 (No turning required).
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 2 (Moderate importance for smooth control).
