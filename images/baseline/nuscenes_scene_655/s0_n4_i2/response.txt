### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving forward at a similar speed

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing the road from the right side, 6 meters ahead
   - Movement: Walking slowly

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead, 10 meters ahead
   - State: Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, so we can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with minor deceleration and acceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been slightly turning to the left, with a gradual increase in the turn angle over the last 4 seconds.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Primary Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Secondary Action**: Be prepared to STOP if the pedestrian steps into the lane.

#### Speed:
- **Adjustment**: DECELERATION to maintain a safe distance from the pedestrian and vehicle ahead.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to ensure safety around the pedestrian and the vehicle ahead. The traffic light is green, so there is no need to stop for the light. However, the pedestrian crossing the road requires careful monitoring. If the pedestrian steps into the lane, the ego vehicle must be ready to stop.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a desired speed quickly, especially since we need to decelerate slightly.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smoother control, balancing responsiveness and smoothness.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance, especially with the pedestrian and vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.5 m/s to decelerate slightly and maintain safety.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.0 rad/s as we are moving forward without turning.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 to ensure smooth control while maintaining the lane.
