### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same lane as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving forward at a slower speed than ego (approx. 2 m/s)

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing from the right to the left, 6 meters ahead
   - Movement: Walking at a moderate pace

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead, 10 meters ahead
   - State: Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, indicating that ego can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- Over the last 4 seconds, ego has been decelerating (speed decreased from 5.5 m/s to 3.64 m/s).
- The turn angle indicates a slight left turn initially, followed by a slight right turn.
- Given the pedestrian crossing ahead and the slower vehicle in the same lane, ego needs to adjust its speed and possibly prepare to stop if the pedestrian is too close.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- Ego will continue moving forward but will decelerate to ensure safety around the pedestrian and the slower vehicle ahead.
- Maintain awareness of the pedestrian crossing and be prepared to stop if necessary.
- Adjust speed to match the slower vehicle ahead to maintain a safe following distance.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a safe and controlled speed, especially given the need to decelerate.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 to allow for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 2.0 m/s to match the slower vehicle ahead and ensure safety around the pedestrian.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the current plan is to move forward without turning.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 to ensure smooth control while maintaining the current lane.
