### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving at a similar speed to ego

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing from left to right, 5 meters ahead
   - Movement: Walking across the road

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Status: Green
   - Distance: 10 meters ahead

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, so we can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant around 4.1 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: There has been a slight increase in acceleration, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle indicates a slight rightward drift over the past 4 seconds.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward, maintaining a constant speed. It will be cautious of the pedestrian crossing the road and ensure it does not collide with the vehicle ahead.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.1,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 to ensure smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.1 m/s to match the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as we are moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
