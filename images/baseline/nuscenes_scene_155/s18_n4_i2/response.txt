### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: Large green container (likely a dumpster) in the right lane, stationary.
2. **Object ID 2**: Parked cars on the right side of the road, stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the images.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (from 5.43 m/s to 3.65 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Increasing slightly (from 0.54 m/s² to 0.96 m/s²).
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly varying, indicating minor adjustments in direction.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The large green container in the right lane is stationary and should be avoided by staying in the left lane. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights that require stopping or significant speed adjustments.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.65,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a constant speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: 3.65 m/s, matching the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: 2 seconds, a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 rad/s, indicating no turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 for smooth control.
