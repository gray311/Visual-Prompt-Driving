### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Vehicles**:
   - **Parked Vehicles**: On the right and left sides of the road.
   - **Moving Vehicles**: One vehicle is moving ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
2. **Pedestrians**: None detected within a 10-meter radius.
3. **Road Markings**: Double solid yellow lines indicating no overtaking.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, around 8.36 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Minor fluctuations in acceleration, indicating a stable speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight variations in the turn angle, suggesting minor steering adjustments.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward at a constant speed, maintaining its lane. The road ahead is clear, with no immediate obstacles or traffic lights. The double solid yellow lines indicate that overtaking is not allowed, so the ego vehicle will stay in its current lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.36,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (Moderate importance on maintaining speed)
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (Low for smoother control)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (Moderate importance on maintaining a safe following distance)
- **Desired Speed**: 8.36 m/s (Current speed)
- **Desired Headway**: 2 seconds (Safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 rad/s (No turning)
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (Moderate importance on smooth yaw control)

This plan ensures that the ego vehicle continues forward safely, maintaining a constant speed and staying in its lane, adhering to the traffic rules and navigation command.
