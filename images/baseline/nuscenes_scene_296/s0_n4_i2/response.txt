### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Pedestrian**: A pedestrian is crossing the road in the first image. The pedestrian is moving from right to left across the crosswalk.
- **Road Markings**: There is a crosswalk visible in the images, indicating a pedestrian crossing area.
- **Lane**: The road appears to be a single lane in each direction with no visible lane markings in the immediate vicinity.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the images.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating over the past 4 seconds, with speeds increasing from 1.49 m/s to 4.83 m/s.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been turning to the right, with the turn angle increasing from 0.0 degrees to 43.01 degrees.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating, with acceleration values ranging from 0.8 m/s² to 1.57 m/s².

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **STOP**: The ego vehicle should stop to yield to the pedestrian crossing the road.

#### Speed:
- **DECELERATION TO ZERO**: The ego vehicle should decelerate to a complete stop to allow the pedestrian to cross safely.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should decelerate and come to a complete stop at the crosswalk to yield to the pedestrian. Once the pedestrian has safely crossed, the vehicle can proceed forward along the road.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 0,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed, which is zero in this case.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth deceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe distance from the pedestrian.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0 m/s to stop the vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds to ensure a safe stopping distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 rad/s as the vehicle should stop and not turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
