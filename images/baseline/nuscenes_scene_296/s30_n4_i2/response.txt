### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects Identified:**
  - **Object 1:** Vehicle ahead in the same lane, approximately 20 meters away.
  - **Object 2:** Another vehicle further ahead in the same lane, approximately 30 meters away.
  
#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing slightly over the past 4 seconds, from 7.58 m/s to 6.82 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle's acceleration has been positive but decreasing, indicating a gradual deceleration.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle is maintaining a slight leftward turn, with the turn angle decreasing from 87.58 degrees to 85.88 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward along the road, maintaining a constant speed. The vehicles ahead are at a safe distance, so no immediate deceleration is required. The ego vehicle should remain aware of the surrounding vehicles and maintain a safe following distance.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 6.82,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** 5 (Moderate importance to maintain the current speed)
- **R (Control Effort):** 0.1 (Low control effort for smoother control)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** 3 (Moderate importance to maintain a safe following distance)
- **Desired Speed:** 6.82 m/s (Current speed of the ego vehicle)
- **Desired Headway:** 2 seconds (Safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** 0 rad/s (No turn, moving straight)
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** 3 (Moderate weight for smooth control)
