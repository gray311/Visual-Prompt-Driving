### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects**:
  - **Vehicle Ahead**: A vehicle is visible in the lane ahead, approximately 30-40 meters away.
  - **Lane Markings**: The lane is clearly marked with a single solid line on the right and a dashed line on the left, indicating that lane changes are permissible to the left.
  - **Road Signs**: The road sign indicates a straight path with an option to turn left.

#### Traffic Light:
- **No Traffic Light**: There are no traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with a slight decrease from 8.01 m/s to 7.58 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly, with values ranging from 0.31 m/s² to 0.68 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been decreasing slightly, indicating a slight rightward adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- **Overall Driving Plan**: Continue moving forward along the road, maintaining a constant speed. Be aware of the vehicle ahead and maintain a safe following distance. No lane changes are necessary at this point.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 7.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 7.5 m/s to maintain a steady speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
