### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1**: Small vehicle (possibly a golf cart) in the same lane as ego, approximately 15-20 meters ahead.
- **Object 2**: Another vehicle further ahead in the same lane, approximately 30-40 meters ahead.
- **Lanes**: Ego is in the right lane, with a clear path ahead. The lane markings indicate a single solid line, suggesting no overtaking.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 4.83 m/s to 7.16 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Decreasing from 1.57 m/s² to 0.34 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing from 43.01° to 85.83°, indicating a right turn or lane change.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. Given the small vehicle ahead, maintain a safe following distance. No lane changes or stops are required as the path is clear and the navigation command is to keep forward.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 7.16,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 7.16 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
