### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Traffic Lights**: The traffic lights are red in all frames, indicating that the ego vehicle must stop.
2. **Vehicles**: 
   - Multiple vehicles are present in the intersection and on the opposite side of the road.
   - Vehicles are moving across the intersection from left to right and right to left.
3. **Pedestrians**: No pedestrians are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing over the last 4 seconds, indicating deceleration.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been decelerating consistently.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been maintaining a slight turn to the left, but the angle is decreasing, indicating a slight correction towards straightening.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **STOP**: The ego vehicle must stop due to the red traffic light.

#### Speed:
- **DECELERATION TO ZERO**: Continue decelerating to a complete stop.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will stop at the stop line due to the red traffic light. It will monitor the traffic light and surrounding vehicles to proceed when the light turns green.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 0,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to emphasize the importance of maintaining the desired speed, especially when stopping.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control during deceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0 to indicate a complete stop.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is stopping and not turning.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
