### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects Identified:**
  - **Vehicle 1:** Black car on the right side of the intersection, preparing to turn or move forward.
  - **Vehicle 2:** White car in the distance, moving forward.
  - **Construction Barrels:** On the right side of the road, indicating a construction zone.
  - **Pedestrian:** No pedestrians detected in the immediate vicinity.

#### Traffic Light:
- **Status:** The traffic light at the intersection is red, indicating a need to stop.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle has been maintaining a speed around 5.23 m/s, with a slight deceleration to 4.94 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle has shown varying acceleration, with a peak of 0.73 m/s².
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been turning slightly to the left, with a decreasing turn angle from 30.74° to 23.06°.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** STOP
- **Speed Adjustment:** DECELERATION TO ZERO

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will stop at the intersection due to the red traffic light. It will decelerate to zero speed, ensuring it stops before the stop line. The vehicle will remain aware of surrounding vehicles, particularly the black car on the right side of the intersection and the white car in the distance.
