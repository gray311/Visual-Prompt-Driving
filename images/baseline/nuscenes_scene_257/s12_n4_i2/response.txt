### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID: 1**
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same lane as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving forward at a similar speed

2. **Object ID: 2**
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Adjacent sidewalk
   - Distance: 6 meters to the right
   - Movement: Stationary

3. **Object ID: 3**
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead
   - Distance: 10 meters ahead
   - State: Green

4. **Object ID: 4**
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Adjacent left lane
   - Distance: 5 meters behind
   - Movement: Moving forward at a slightly higher speed

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, so the ego vehicle can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating over the last 4 seconds, increasing from 0.44 m/s to 2.88 m/s.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been making slight adjustments to its direction, with a recent slight right turn (8.0 degrees).
- **Behavior**: The ego vehicle is currently moving forward and accelerating.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue to move forward, maintaining awareness of the vehicle in the same lane ahead and the vehicle in the adjacent left lane. Given the green traffic light, there is no need to stop. The ego vehicle should continue to accelerate to reach a comfortable cruising speed while maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (Moderate importance to maintain desired speed)
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (Moderate control effort for smooth acceleration)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (Moderate importance to maintain safe following distance)
- **Desired Speed**: 5.0 m/s (Target cruising speed)
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds (Safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0.0 rad/s (No turning, moving straight)
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (Moderate weight for smooth control)
