### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Position: 8 meters ahead in the same lane
   - Movement: Moving forward at a similar speed to ego

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Position: 6 meters to the right, on the sidewalk
   - Movement: Stationary

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Position: 15 meters ahead
   - State: Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, so we can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively stable, with a slight increase followed by a minor decrease.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been positive, indicating a general trend of speeding up.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been increasing negatively, indicating a leftward turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward at a constant speed, maintaining awareness of the vehicle ahead and the pedestrian on the sidewalk. Given the green traffic light, there is no need to stop or decelerate significantly.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.6,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.6 m/s, reflecting the current speed trend.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as we are moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
