### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving forward at a similar speed

2. **Object ID 2**:
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing the road from the right side, 6 meters ahead
   - Movement: Walking at a moderate pace

3. **Object ID 3**:
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead, 10 meters ahead
   - Status: Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, so we can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- Over the last 4 seconds, the ego vehicle has been decelerating (speed reduced from 4.06 m/s to 2.28 m/s).
- The turn angle indicates a slight right turn, which has been increasing over time.
- Current speed is 2.28 m/s, and the vehicle is still moving forward.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward as per the navigation command.
- Accelerate to maintain a safe speed while being aware of the pedestrian crossing the road.
- Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize reaching and maintaining the desired speed quickly.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for a balance between smooth control and responsiveness.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 3.5 m/s to safely accelerate while being aware of the pedestrian.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving forward without needing to turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control adjustments.
