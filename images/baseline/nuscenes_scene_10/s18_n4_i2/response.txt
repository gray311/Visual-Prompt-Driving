### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object 1 (Truck on the left)**:
   - Lane: Leftmost lane
   - Movement: Stationary
   - Impact: Blocking part of the left lane

2. **Object 2 (Truck on the right)**:
   - Lane: Rightmost lane
   - Movement: Stationary
   - Impact: Blocking part of the right lane

3. **Object 3 (Construction Workers)**:
   - Lane: Leftmost lane
   - Movement: Directing traffic
   - Impact: Indicating to proceed with caution

4. **Object 4 (White Car ahead)**:
   - Lane: Middle lane
   - Movement: Moving forward
   - Impact: Potential obstacle if it slows down or stops

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with a slight decrease in the last second.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been turning slightly to the right.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED
- **Summary**: Proceed forward while maintaining a constant speed. Be cautious of the construction workers and the stationary trucks on both sides. Ensure to stay in the middle lane and maintain a safe distance from the white car ahead.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED
- **Summary**: The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed, staying in the middle lane, and maintaining a safe distance from the white car ahead. Be cautious of the construction workers and the stationary trucks on both sides.
