### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object 1 (White Car)**
   - **Lane**: Right lane, parked on the side.
   - **Movement**: Stationary.
   - **Impact**: No immediate impact on the ego vehicle.

2. **Object 2 (Silver Car)**
   - **Lane**: Right lane, ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - **Movement**: Moving forward slowly.
   - **Impact**: Requires maintaining a safe following distance.

3. **Object 3 (Construction Worker)**
   - **Lane**: Right lane, near the construction site.
   - **Movement**: Stationary.
   - **Impact**: No immediate impact but requires caution.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant with a slight increase.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been turning slightly to the right.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED
- **Summary**: Continue moving forward while maintaining a safe distance from the silver car ahead. Be cautious of the construction area on the right.

#### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.5,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed while maintaining a safe distance from the silver car ahead. The construction area on the right should be noted, but it does not require any immediate action. The MPC parameters are set to ensure smooth control and safe following distance.
