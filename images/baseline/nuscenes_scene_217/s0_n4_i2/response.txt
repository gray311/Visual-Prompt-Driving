### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Vehicle 1 (ID: 1)**:
   - Position: Parked on the left side of the road.
   - Lane: Adjacent to the curb, not in the driving lane.
   - Movement: Stationary.

2. **Vehicle 2 (ID: 2)**:
   - Position: Ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
   - Lane: Center of the driving lane.
   - Movement: Moving forward.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has increased from 0.01 m/s to 2.43 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has decreased from 1.42 m/s² to 0.55 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has become more negative, indicating a slight rightward turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. There is a parked vehicle on the left side of the road, but it does not obstruct the driving lane. The vehicle ahead is moving forward, so the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 2.5 m/s to match the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
