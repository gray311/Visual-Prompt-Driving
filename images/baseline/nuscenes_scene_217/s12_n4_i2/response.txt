### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Vehicle (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Center lane, moving forward.
   - Movement: Moving in the same direction as ego, maintaining a consistent distance.
2. **Pedestrian (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: Right sidewalk.
   - Movement: Stationary, no immediate impact on ego.
3. **Bicycle (ID: 3)**:
   - Lane: Right sidewalk.
   - Movement: Stationary, no immediate impact on ego.
4. **Vehicle (ID: 4)**:
   - Lane: Center lane, further ahead.
   - Movement: Moving forward, no immediate impact on ego.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively stable, with slight fluctuations between 4.7 m/s and 5.04 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has experienced minor acceleration changes, indicating a generally steady speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been making slight turns, with angles ranging from 2.11° to 7.32°.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop. The surrounding vehicles and pedestrians are not in the path of the ego vehicle, allowing for safe forward movement.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.0 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
