### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Orange Car (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, parked on the side.
   - Movement: Stationary.
2. **Motorcycle (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, near the sidewalk.
   - Movement: Stationary.
3. **Red Car (ID: 3)**:
   - Lane: Left lane, parked on the side.
   - Movement: Stationary.
4. **Bus (ID: 4)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, further ahead.
   - Movement: Stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (2.42 m/s to 0.22 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Fluctuating, with a significant deceleration in the last second.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight left turn indicated over the last 4 seconds.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward along the road while accelerating to regain speed. There are no immediate obstacles in the lane ahead, and the navigation command is to keep forward. The parked vehicles and motorcycle on the right side do not pose an immediate threat but should be monitored.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.5,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (Moderate importance on maintaining desired speed).
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (Low value for smoother control).
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (Moderate importance on maintaining safe following distance).
- **Desired Speed**: 2.5 m/s (Target speed to regain momentum).
- **Desired Headway**: 2 seconds (Safe following distance).
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 rad/s (No turning required, moving straight).
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 2 (Moderate importance on smooth yaw control).
