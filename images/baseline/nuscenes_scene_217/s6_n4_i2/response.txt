### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Vehicle 1**: A van is parked on the left side of the road.
- **Vehicle 2**: An orange car is moving ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
- **Vehicle 3**: A white car is moving ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
- **Pedestrian/Bicyclist**: A person on a bicycle is visible on the right side of the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing over the last 4 seconds (2.43 m/s to 4.74 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating, with the acceleration increasing from 0.55 m/s² to 1.24 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been turning slightly to the right, as indicated by the turn angle changing from -11.17 degrees to 2.11 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. It should be aware of the orange car and white car ahead and maintain a safe following distance. The ego vehicle should also be cautious of the bicyclist on the right side of the road.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.74,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed of 4.74 m/s, maintaining a safe following distance of 2.0 seconds from the vehicles ahead. The yaw rate should be kept at 0 for straight movement, with a moderate yaw rate weight to ensure smooth control.
