### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID: 1 (Black SUV)**
   - Lane: Center lane
   - Movement: Moving forward, initially turning left but then straightening out.
   - Impact: The vehicle is ahead of the ego vehicle and is moving in the same direction. It is crucial to maintain a safe following distance.

2. **Object ID: 2 (Silver Sedan)**
   - Lane: Left lane
   - Movement: Moving forward, potentially merging into the center lane.
   - Impact: The vehicle is on the left side and may merge into the center lane. It is important to monitor its movement closely.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing over the last 4 seconds (1.78 m/s to 3.85 m/s).
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle's acceleration has been positive, indicating an increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has a slight left turn angle, which has been decreasing, indicating a straightening out of the vehicle's path.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. It is important to keep a safe following distance from the black SUV ahead and monitor the silver sedan on the left for any potential lane changes.

- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** 5 (to maintain the desired speed effectively)
- **R (Control Effort):** 0.1 (for smooth control)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** 3 (to maintain a safe following distance)
- **Desired Speed:** 3.85 m/s (current speed of the ego vehicle)
- **Desired Headway:** 2.0 seconds (safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** 0 (straight path)
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** 3 (for smooth control)
