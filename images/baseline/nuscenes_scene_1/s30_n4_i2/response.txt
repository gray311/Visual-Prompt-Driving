### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Vehicle (ID: 1)**: 
   - Lane: Center lane
   - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a steady speed.
2. **Bicyclist (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, near the parked vehicles.
   - Movement: Moving forward, likely slower than the ego vehicle.
3. **Parked Vehicles**:
   - Lane: Both sides of the road.
   - Movement: Stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 6.4 m/s to 8.0 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Decreasing from 0.87 m/s² to 0.41 m/s², indicating a gradual reduction in acceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly negative, indicating a slight leftward orientation.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **MOVE FORWARD**: Continue moving forward as per the navigation command.
- **STEER SLIGHTLY LEFT**: Adjust the steering to maintain the lane and avoid the bicyclist.

#### Speed:
- **CONSTANT SPEED**: Maintain the current speed of 8.0 m/s, as there are no immediate obstacles in the path.

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward while slightly adjusting the steering to the left to ensure the vehicle remains centered in the lane and avoids the bicyclist on the right. Maintain a constant speed to ensure smooth traffic flow.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed efficiently.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: 8.0 m/s to maintain current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0.1 rad/s to slightly steer left.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 2 for balanced control.
