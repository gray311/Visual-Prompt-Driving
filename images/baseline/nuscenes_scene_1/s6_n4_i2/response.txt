### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Vehicle 1**: 
   - Position: Left lane, moving forward.
   - Movement: Approaching intersection, likely to continue straight.
2. **Vehicle 2**: 
   - Position: Right lane, moving forward.
   - Movement: Approaching intersection, likely to continue straight.
3. **Vehicle 3**: 
   - Position: Right lane, parked.
   - Movement: Stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- Current state: Yellow.
- Action: Proceed with caution if past the stop line; otherwise, prepare to stop.

#### Ego Analysis:
- Speed: Decreasing from 8.91 m/s to 5.9 m/s.
- Acceleration: Increasing, indicating deceleration to a stop.
- Turn Angle: Slight left turn, stabilizing around -10.99 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION
- **Summary**: Proceed forward with caution, decelerate to stop if not past the stop line. Maintain awareness of surrounding vehicles, especially those approaching the intersection.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD with DECELERATION.
- **Speed**: Adjust to 5.0 m/s, decelerate to stop if necessary.
- **Conditions**: Monitor traffic light, proceed with caution if yellow. Maintain awareness of surrounding vehicles and ensure safe headway.
