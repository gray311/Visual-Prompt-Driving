### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Pedestrians**:
   - Multiple pedestrians are crossing the road in front of the ego vehicle.
   - They are moving from right to left across the crosswalk.

2. **Vehicles**:
   - A red car is visible in the distance, moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - No immediate threat from other vehicles within a 10-meter radius.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing slightly over the last 4 seconds, stabilizing at 5.21 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has varied, with a peak of 1.16 m/sÂ².
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been increasing, indicating the vehicle is in the process of turning.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **STOP**: Due to the presence of pedestrians crossing the road.

#### Speed:
- **DECELERATION TO ZERO**: To safely stop for the pedestrians.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle needs to stop to allow pedestrians to cross safely. Once the pedestrians have crossed, the vehicle can resume moving forward along the road.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 0,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed after stopping.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0 to stop the vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds for safety.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle will be stopping.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control during the stop.
