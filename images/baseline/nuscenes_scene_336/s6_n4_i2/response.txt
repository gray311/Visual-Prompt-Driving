### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Bus (ID: 1)**: 
  - Lane: Right lane.
  - Movement: Moving forward, approaching the speed bump.
- **Car (ID: 2)**: 
  - Lane: Right lane.
  - Movement: Moving forward, ahead of the bus.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing gradually from 3.65 m/s to 4.99 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating increasing speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly negative, indicating a slight left turn initially, then correcting to a less negative angle.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **MOVE FORWARD**: Continue moving forward along the road.
- **STEER SLIGHTLY LEFT**: Adjust the steering to the left to stay in the lane and avoid the bus.

#### Speed:
- **DECELERATION**: Slow down slightly to safely navigate the speed bump and maintain a safe distance from the bus and car ahead.

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward while steering slightly left to stay in the lane.
- Decelerate to safely navigate the speed bump and maintain a safe distance from the bus and car ahead.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,

  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a desired speed while navigating the speed bump.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 3.0 m/s to decelerate and safely navigate the speed bump.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the bus and car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.1 for a slight left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth steering control.
