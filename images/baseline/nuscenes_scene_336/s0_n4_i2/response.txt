### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects:**
  - **Bus (ID: 1):** Located ahead in the same lane, moving slowly or stationary.
  - **Car (ID: 2):** Located ahead in the same lane, moving slowly or stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the images.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Increasing over the last 4 seconds from 0.73 m/s to 3.65 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** Gradually increasing from 0.3 m/s² to 0.52 m/s².
- **Turn Angle:** Slight adjustments with a minor left turn followed by a right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD with caution.
- **Speed Adjustment:** DECELERATION to adjust to the presence of the bus and car ahead.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating to maintain a safe distance from the bus and car ahead. The presence of a speed hump also necessitates a reduction in speed.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 1.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain a desired speed of 1.5 m/s, considering the need to slow down for the speed hump and the vehicles ahead.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smoother control, allowing for gradual deceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 1.5 m/s to safely navigate the speed hump and maintain a safe distance from the bus and car.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the road ahead is straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smoother control.
