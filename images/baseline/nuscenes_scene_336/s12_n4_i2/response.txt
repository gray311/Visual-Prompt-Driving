### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Bus (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Adjacent lane to the right.
   - Movement: Moving forward and exiting the frame to the right.

2. **Car (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a consistent distance ahead.

3. **Pedestrians (ID: 3)**:
   - Lane: Sidewalk, not directly in the lane but near the crosswalk.
   - Movement: Walking towards the crosswalk.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant around 5 m/s, with minor fluctuations.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly, indicating a steady increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been making slight adjustments to the left and right, indicating minor steering corrections.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **MOVE FORWARD**: Continue moving forward along the road.
- **STEER SLIGHTLY LEFT**: Adjust steering slightly to the left to stay centered in the lane and avoid the bus on the right.

#### Speed:
- **CONSTANT SPEED**: Maintain a constant speed to match the flow of traffic and ensure safety.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while making slight steering adjustments to the left to stay centered in the lane. Maintain a constant speed to match the flow of traffic and ensure safety, especially with the pedestrians approaching the crosswalk.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.0 m/s to match the current speed and maintain traffic flow.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.1 for a slight left steering adjustment.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control during steering adjustments.
