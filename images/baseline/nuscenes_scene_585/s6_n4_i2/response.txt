### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **UPS Truck (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Stationary or moving very slowly.
   - Impact: Blocking the right lane, requiring careful maneuvering.

2. **Other Vehicles (ID: 2, 3, 4, etc.)**:
   - Lane: Parked on the sides of the road.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact but reduce available space on the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the images.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (from 3.2 m/s to 1.54 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Generally positive but low, indicating a gradual deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight variations, indicating minor steering adjustments.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed**: DECELERATION.
- **Summary**: Continue moving forward while decelerating to avoid collision with the UPS truck. Prepare to maneuver around the truck if necessary.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 1.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating to avoid a collision with the UPS truck ahead. The vehicle should be prepared to maneuver around the truck if it remains stationary or moves very slowly. The MPC control signals are set to maintain a safe speed and headway while allowing for smooth control adjustments.
