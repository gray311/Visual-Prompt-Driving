### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Object**: Truck (ID: 1)
  - **Lane**: Right lane, partially off the road.
  - **Movement**: Stationary, parked on the side of the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (7.1 m/s to 5.37 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Decreasing (1.63 m/s² to 0.6 m/s²).
- **Turn Angle**: Increasingly negative, indicating a right turn.

### High-Level Plan:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED
- **Summary**: Continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The truck on the right is stationary and does not pose an immediate threat. Ensure to stay in the left lane and avoid the truck.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": -0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a desired speed quickly.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.5 m/s to maintain a constant speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to -0.1 rad/s to slightly steer right and stay in the lane.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
