### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 1**: Vehicle ahead in the same lane, moving forward.
- **Object ID 2**: Parked vehicles on the left side of the road, not in the driving lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with minor fluctuations around 9.6 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has experienced slight acceleration, indicating a stable driving pattern.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been straightening its path, moving from a slight left turn to a nearly straight trajectory.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **MOVE FORWARD**: Continue moving forward along the road.

#### Speed:
- **CONSTANT SPEED**: Maintain the current speed, as the road ahead is clear and there are no immediate obstacles.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed, maintaining awareness of the vehicle ahead and the parked vehicles on the left side. The road appears clear, and there are no immediate hazards or traffic lights to consider.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 9.6,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 9.6 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
