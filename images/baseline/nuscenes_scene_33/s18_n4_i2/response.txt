### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 1**: Vehicle ahead in the same lane, moving slowly or stationary.
- **Object ID 2**: Parked vehicles on the left side of the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (from 9.56 m/s to 7.1 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Increasing (from 0.82 m/s² to 1.63 m/s²).
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly increasing, indicating a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. The road curves slightly to the left, so the vehicle should adjust its speed and steering accordingly.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a safe and controlled speed during the slight left turn.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 to allow for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.0 m/s to match the deceleration plan.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.1 rad/s to accommodate the slight left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 to balance smooth control with the need to follow the road curvature.
