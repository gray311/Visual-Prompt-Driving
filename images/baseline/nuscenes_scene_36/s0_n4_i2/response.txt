### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Vehicle 1 (Truck)**:
   - **Position**: Left lane, stationary or moving very slowly.
   - **Impact**: Potential obstacle if ego vehicle needs to change lanes or overtake.

2. **Vehicle 2 (Car)**:
   - **Position**: Right lane, moving forward.
   - **Impact**: Moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, needs to be monitored for safe following distance.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 4.81 m/s to 6.42 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating the vehicle is speeding up.
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing, indicating a slight turn to the left.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining a safe distance from the car in the right lane. The truck in the left lane is stationary or moving slowly, so no immediate lane change is necessary. The ego vehicle should maintain a constant speed and be prepared to adjust if the car ahead slows down or if a lane change becomes necessary.

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (Moderate importance to maintain the current speed).
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (Low value for smooth control).
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (Moderate importance for maintaining a safe following distance).
- **Desired Speed**: 6.42 m/s (Current speed).
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds (Safe following distance).
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 (No turn required).
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 2 (Moderate importance for smooth control).
