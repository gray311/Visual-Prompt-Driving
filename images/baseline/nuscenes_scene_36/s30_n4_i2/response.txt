### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Object**: Vehicle ahead (ID: 1)
  - **Lane**: Same lane as ego vehicle
  - **Movement**: Moving forward, slightly to the right

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 7.97 m/s to 8.43 m/s
- **Acceleration**: Decreasing from 2.61 m/s² to 1.48 m/s²
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing left turn from -6.99° to -48.71°

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The road curves to the right, so the vehicle should adjust its steering slightly to the right to follow the road curvature. The vehicle ahead is in the same lane but at a safe distance, so no immediate action is required to avoid it.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.43,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": -0.2,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smoother control during the slight right turn.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 8.43 m/s, the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds, a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to -0.2 rad/s for a slight right turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control.
