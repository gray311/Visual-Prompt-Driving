### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Key Objects Identified:**
   - **Cars:**
     - ID 6: Parked on the left side of the road.
     - IDs 13, 14, 15: Parked on the right side of the road.
     - IDs 19, 20, 21: Parked on the left side of the road.
   - **Lane Lines:**
     - ID 16: Lane line on the left side of the road.
     - ID 23: Lane line on the right side of the road.
   - **Construction Cones:** Indicating a construction zone ahead.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing over the past 4 seconds from 5.54 m/s to 3.54 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The acceleration has also been decreasing, indicating a deceleration trend.
- **Turn Angle:** The turn angle has been relatively stable, indicating a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The construction zone ahead requires careful navigation, but there are no immediate obstacles in the lane. The parked cars on both sides of the road do not pose a threat as they are stationary and outside the driving lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 for a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 3.5 m/s to maintain a steady speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0.1 rad/s for slight left steering.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control.
