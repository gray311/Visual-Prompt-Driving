### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 17 (car):** Positioned in the left lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 20 (car):** Positioned in the left lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 21 (car):** Positioned in the right lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 24 (car):** Positioned in the right lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 25 (car):** Positioned in the right lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 26 (car):** Positioned in the right lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 28 (loneline):** Positioned in the left lane, marking the lane boundary.

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is not clearly visible in the provided frames. Assume it is green based on the movement of other vehicles.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with a slight decrease in the last second.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been turning slightly to the right, indicating a lane adjustment or slight curve.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. Be cautious of the surrounding vehicles, especially those in the left and right lanes. Ensure to stay within the lane boundaries marked by the loneline.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain a constant speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 5.0 m/s to maintain current speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds for safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 for moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control.
