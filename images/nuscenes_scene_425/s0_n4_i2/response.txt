### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Notable Objects:**
  - **Object 1 (Car)**: Positioned in the middle lane, moving slowly.
  - **Object 2 (Car)**: Positioned in the middle lane, moving slowly.
  - **Object 3 (Car)**: Positioned in the middle lane, moving slowly.
  - **Object 4 (Car)**: Positioned in the middle lane, moving slowly.
  - **Object 5 (Laneline)**: Positioned on the left side of the road.
  - **Object 6 (Car)**: Positioned in the left lane, moving slowly.
  - **Object 7 (Car)**: Positioned in the left lane, moving slowly.
  - **Object 8 (Car)**: Positioned in the middle lane, moving slowly.
  - **Object 9 (Car)**: Positioned in the middle lane, moving slowly.
  - **Object 10 (Car)**: Positioned in the left lane, moving slowly.
  - **Object 11 (Laneline)**: Positioned on the right side of the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively stable, with slight fluctuations between 7.09 m/s and 7.8 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating, with values ranging from 0.6 m/s² to 1.64 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been turning to the left, with the turn angle increasing from 0.0 degrees to 19.65 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. It should be aware of the surrounding vehicles, especially those in the middle lane, and maintain a safe distance. The ego vehicle should stay in its current lane and avoid any sudden lane changes or turns.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 7.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q**: Set to 5 to emphasize maintaining the desired speed.
- **R**: Set to 0.1 for smoother control.
- **Q_h**: Set to 3 for maintaining a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 7.5 m/s to maintain a constant speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control.
