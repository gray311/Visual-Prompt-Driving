### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 17 (Car)**: In the left lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 21 (Car)**: In the middle lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 25 (Car)**: In the left lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 26 (Car)**: In the right lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 28 (Lane Line)**: Marking the lane boundaries.
  - **ID 29 (Car)**: In the middle lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 30 (Car)**: In the middle lane, moving forward.

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is red, indicating that the ego vehicle must stop.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing over the last 4 seconds (from 4.94 m/s to 3.36 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been decelerating, with acceleration values indicating a reduction in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been turning slightly to the left (from 23.06 degrees to 18.07 degrees).

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: STOP
- **Speed**: DECELERATION TO ZERO

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should come to a complete stop due to the red traffic light. The surrounding vehicles are moving forward, but the traffic light dictates that the ego vehicle must stop to comply with traffic rules.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 0,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed, which is zero in this case.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control as the vehicle comes to a stop.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance, though the vehicle is stopping.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0 m/s as the vehicle needs to stop.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds to maintain a safe distance if there were a vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is stopping and not turning.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control during the stop.
