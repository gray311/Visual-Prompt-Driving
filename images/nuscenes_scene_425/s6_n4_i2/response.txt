### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects:**
  - **Car 1:** In the right lane, moving forward.
  - **Car 6:** Parked on the left side.
  - **Car 7:** Parked on the left side.
  - **Car 8:** In the right lane, moving forward.
  - **Car 13, 14, 15:** Parked on the right side.
  - **Lane Lines:** Clearly marked on both sides.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Decreasing over the last 4 seconds from 7.09 m/s to 5.54 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** Slightly decreasing but relatively constant.
- **Turn Angle:** Increasing slightly, indicating a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead (Car 1 and Car 8). The road is clear with no immediate obstacles or traffic lights. The ego vehicle should stay in its current lane and be cautious of parked cars on both sides.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain a desired speed quickly.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 for a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 5.0 m/s to decelerate slightly.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0.1 for a slight left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control during the turn.
