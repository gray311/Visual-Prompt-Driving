### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects Identified:**
  - **Car IDs:** 19, 20, 21, 23, 24
  - **Lanes:** 
    - **Car 19:** Middle lane, moving forward.
    - **Car 20:** Left lane, moving forward.
    - **Car 21:** Middle lane, moving forward.
    - **Car 23:** Lane line marking.
    - **Car 24:** Middle lane, moving forward.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing steadily from 3.54 m/s to 5.11 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The acceleration has been positive, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The turn angle has been increasing, indicating a slight turn to the left.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The road ahead is clear, and there are no immediate obstacles within the 10-meter radius. The ego vehicle should be aware of the surrounding vehicles, especially those in the middle lane, and maintain a safe distance.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.11,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 5.11 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for balanced control.
