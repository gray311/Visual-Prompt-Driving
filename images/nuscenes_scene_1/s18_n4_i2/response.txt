### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object IDs and Lanes:**
   - **ID 8 (Bus):** In the right lane, moving forward.
   - **ID 9 (Car):** In the right lane, moving forward.
   - **ID 20 (Car):** In the left lane, moving forward.
   - **ID 22 (Car):** Parked on the right side of the road.
   - **ID 24 (Lane Line):** Double solid yellow line separating lanes.

2. **Traffic Light:**
   - No traffic light is visible in the provided images.

3. **Ego Analysis:**
   - **Speed:** Increasing from 1.78 m/s to 3.85 m/s.
   - **Acceleration:** Increasing from 0.12 m/s² to 1.04 m/s².
   - **Turn Angle:** Slightly decreasing from -11.17° to -11.05°, indicating a slight leftward orientation.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action:** Change lane to the right.
- **Speed Adjustment:** Maintain a constant speed initially, then decelerate slightly to ensure a safe lane change.

#### Summary:
- The right lane appears clear, but there are moving vehicles (bus and car) in the right lane. The ego vehicle should change lanes to the right while maintaining a safe distance from these vehicles.

}
```

### Detailed Plan:
1. **Initiate Lane Change:**
   - **Behavior:** Change lane to the right.
   - **Speed:** Decelerate slightly to ensure a safe lane change.
   - **Conditions:** Ensure there is enough space between the ego vehicle and the bus (ID 8) and car (ID 9) in the right lane.

2. **Maintain Safe Distance:**
   - **Behavior:** Maintain a constant speed once in the right lane.
   - **Speed:** Adjust speed to match the flow of traffic in the right lane.
   - **Conditions:** Keep a safe distance from the bus and car in the right lane.

3. **Monitor Surroundings:**
   - **Behavior:** Continuously monitor the surroundings for any changes in traffic conditions.
   - **Speed:** Adjust speed as necessary to maintain safety and compliance with traffic rules.
   - **Conditions:** Be prepared to decelerate or stop if any unexpected obstacles or changes in traffic conditions occur.
