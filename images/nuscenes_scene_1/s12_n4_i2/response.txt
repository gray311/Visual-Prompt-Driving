### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 6 (Car):** In the left lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 7 (Car):** Parked in the right lane.
  - **ID 9 (Bus):** In the left lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 10 (Car):** In the left lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 15 (Lane Line):** Marking the left lane.
  - **ID 17 (Lane Line):** Marking the right lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Decreasing over the past 4 seconds (from 5.9 m/s to 1.78 m/s).
- **Acceleration:** Decreasing (from 2.79 m/s² to 0.12 m/s²).
- **Turn Angle:** Slightly negative, indicating a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action:** CHANGE LANE TO RIGHT
- **Speed Adjustment:** ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The right lane is clear except for a parked car (ID 7). The ego vehicle should change to the right lane as per the navigation command. The ego vehicle should accelerate slightly to match the traffic flow.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": -0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle reaches the desired speed quickly.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for a smooth lane change.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 3.0 m/s to match the traffic flow.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds for safety.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to -0.1 for a slight right turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control during the lane change.
