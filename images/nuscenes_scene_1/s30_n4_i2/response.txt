### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Notable Objects:**
   - **ID 26 (Bus):** In the left lane, stationary.
   - **ID 25 (Car):** In the right lane, stationary.
   - **ID 8 (Car):** In the center lane, moving forward.
   - **ID 30 (Car):** In the left lane, stationary.
   - **ID 32 (Laneline):** Center lane marking.
   - **ID 27 (Laneline):** Left lane marking.
   - **ID 31 (Car):** In the right lane, stationary.
   - **ID 22 (Car):** In the right lane, stationary.
   - **ID 29 (Bus):** In the right lane, stationary.
   - **ID 34 (Car):** In the right lane, stationary.
   - **ID 35 (Car):** In the right lane, stationary.
   - **ID 33 (Car):** In the right lane, stationary.
   - **ID 36 (Laneline):** Right lane marking.
   - **ID 37 (Laneline):** Right lane marking.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Increasing from 6.4 m/s to 8.0 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** Decreasing from 0.87 m/s² to 0.41 m/s².
- **Turn Angle:** Slight left turn angle, decreasing from -12.11° to -12.16°.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action:** CHANGE LANE TO RIGHT
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The right lane appears clear for a lane change. The ego vehicle should change to the right lane while maintaining a constant speed. Ensure to monitor the stationary vehicles in the right lane and adjust if necessary.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": -0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed during the lane change.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for a smooth control response during the lane change.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 8.0 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds for safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to -0.1 for a slight right turn to change lanes.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control during the lane change.
