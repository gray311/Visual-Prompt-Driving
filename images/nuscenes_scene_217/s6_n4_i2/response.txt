### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **Car (ID: 2):** Left lane, moving forward.
  - **Car (ID: 6):** Center lane, moving forward.
  - **Car (ID: 3):** Center lane, moving forward.
  - **Car (ID: 9):** Center lane, moving forward.
  - **Car (ID: 11):** Center lane, moving forward.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Increasing from 2.43 m/s to 4.74 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** Increasing, indicating the vehicle is speeding up.
- **Turn Angle:** Changing from -11.17 degrees to 2.11 degrees, indicating a slight right turn followed by straightening out.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. There are multiple vehicles ahead in the center lane, so the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to decelerate if necessary.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.74,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 4.74 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle should move straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for balanced control.
