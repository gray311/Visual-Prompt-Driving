### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects:**
  - **Car 1:** Directly ahead in the same lane, moving forward.
  - **Car 3:** Ahead in the same lane, moving forward.
  - **Car 9:** In the left lane, moving forward.
  - **Car 10:** In the right lane, moving forward.
  - **Car 11:** In the left lane, moving forward.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has decreased significantly over the last 4 seconds, from 2.42 m/s to 0.22 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle has experienced varying acceleration, with a notable deceleration recently.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been turning slightly to the right, as indicated by the negative turn angles.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while accelerating to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead (Car 1). The road is clear of pedestrians and other obstacles, and the navigation command is to keep forward along the road.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to prioritize reaching the desired speed quickly.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 2.0 m/s to match the road conditions and traffic flow.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for balanced control.
