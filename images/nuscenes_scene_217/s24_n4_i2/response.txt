### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 3 (Car):** Directly ahead in the same lane.
  - **ID 11 (Car):** Ahead in the same lane, behind ID 3.
  - **ID 13 (Car):** Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 10 (Car):** Ahead in the same lane, behind ID 11.
  - **ID 16 (Lane Line):** Lane line on the right side.
  - **ID 17 (Lane Line):** Lane line on the right side.

- **Movements Relative to Ego:**
  - **ID 3 (Car):** Moving forward at a similar speed.
  - **ID 11 (Car):** Moving forward at a similar speed.
  - **ID 13 (Car):** Stationary.
  - **ID 10 (Car):** Moving forward at a similar speed.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has decreased significantly over the last 4 seconds, from 2.42 m/s to 0.22 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle has experienced varying acceleration, with a notable deceleration in the last second.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been turning slightly to the left, with the turn angle increasing from -0.1 to -3.18 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while accelerating to match the flow of traffic. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the car directly ahead (ID 3) and be cautious of the parked car on the left (ID 13).

### MPC Signals:

  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 2.5 m/s to match the flow of traffic.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 for moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for balanced control.
