### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 3 (Car):** In the same lane as ego, directly ahead.
  - **ID 7 (Car):** In the same lane as ego, directly ahead, slightly to the right of ID 3.
  - **ID 8 (Car):** In the left lane, moving parallel to ego.
  - **ID 9 (Car):** In the left lane, moving parallel to ego.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with minor fluctuations around 4.7 to 5.04 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle has experienced minor accelerations and decelerations, indicating slight adjustments in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been making slight turns, with angles varying between 2.11 and 7.32 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed, maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead (ID 3 and ID 7). There is no need for lane changes or stops as the road ahead is clear and the navigation command is to keep forward along the road.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.8,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed efficiently.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 4.8 m/s, which is within the current speed range.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the ego vehicle is to move straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for balanced control.
