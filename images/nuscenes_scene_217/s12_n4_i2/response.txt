### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 3 (Car):** In the same lane as the ego vehicle, directly ahead.
  - **ID 9 (Car):** In the left lane, moving parallel to the ego vehicle.
  - **ID 11 (Car):** In the same lane as the ego vehicle, directly ahead.
  - **ID 14 (Car):** In the left lane, moving parallel to the ego vehicle.
  - **ID 15 (Lane Line):** Lane line marking the boundary of the ego vehicle's lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with minor fluctuations between 4.7 m/s and 5.04 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle has experienced minor accelerations and decelerations, indicating slight adjustments in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been maintaining a slight turn to the left, with turn angles ranging from 2.11 to 7.32 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop. The ego vehicle should be aware of the cars in the left lane and maintain a safe distance from the car directly ahead in the same lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain a constant speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 5.0 m/s to match the current speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control.
