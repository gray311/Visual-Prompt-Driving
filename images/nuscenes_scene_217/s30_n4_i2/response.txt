### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object IDs and Lanes:**
   - **ID 1 (Car):** Directly ahead in the same lane.
   - **ID 3 (Car):** Directly ahead in the same lane.
   - **ID 9 (Car):** Ahead in the same lane.
   - **ID 10 (Car):** Ahead in the same lane.
   - **ID 11 (Car):** Ahead in the same lane.
   - **ID 12 (Car):** Ahead in the same lane.
   - **ID 13 (Car):** Ahead in the same lane.

2. **Movements Relative to Ego:**
   - The cars ahead (IDs 1, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13) are stationary or moving slowly, causing a potential obstruction.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle has been nearly stationary for the past 4 seconds, with a slight increase in speed to 0.22 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has a slight left turn angle, indicating a minor adjustment in the lane.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while accelerating to maintain a safe distance from the stationary or slow-moving vehicles ahead. Given the slight left turn angle, the ego vehicle should ensure it stays within its lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smoother control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 2.0 m/s to allow for gradual acceleration.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0.1 rad/s to account for the slight left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smoother control during the slight turn.
