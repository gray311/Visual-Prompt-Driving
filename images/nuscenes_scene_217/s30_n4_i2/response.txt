### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 3 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Same as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly.
   - Impact: Directly in front of the ego vehicle, requiring careful consideration for collision avoidance.

2. **Object ID 13 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Same as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly.
   - Impact: Further ahead in the same lane, but still within the 10-meter radius.

3. **Object ID 10 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Same as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly.
   - Impact: Further ahead in the same lane, but still within the 10-meter radius.

4. **Object ID 11 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Same as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly.
   - Impact: Further ahead in the same lane, but still within the 10-meter radius.

5. **Object ID 18 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Same as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly.
   - Impact: Further ahead in the same lane, but still within the 10-meter radius.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle has been mostly stationary with a slight initial movement (0.22 m/s) and then stopped.
- **Acceleration**: Minor acceleration changes, indicating a stop-and-go scenario.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight left turn angle, but mostly stable.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: ACCELERATION to a safe speed, considering the stationary vehicles ahead.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should move forward with caution, maintaining a safe distance from the stationary vehicles ahead. Given the navigation command to keep forward and be aware of surrounding vehicles, the ego vehicle should proceed slowly and be prepared to stop if necessary.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle reaches the desired speed quickly.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 2.0 m/s, a cautious speed given the stationary vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
