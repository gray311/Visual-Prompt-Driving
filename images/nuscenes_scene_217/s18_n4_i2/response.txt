### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 3 (Orange Car):** In the same lane as the ego vehicle, approximately 8-10 meters ahead.
  - **ID 11 (Blue Car):** In the same lane as the ego vehicle, behind the orange car.
  - **ID 14 (Blue Car):** In the adjacent lane to the left, moving parallel to the ego vehicle.
  - **ID 13 (Blue Car):** In the adjacent lane to the left, moving parallel to the ego vehicle.
  - **ID 16 (Lane Line):** Lane markings indicating the current lane and adjacent lanes.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle has been decelerating over the past 4 seconds, with speeds reducing from 4.7 m/s to 2.42 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle has been experiencing positive acceleration, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been slightly turning left, but the turn angle is minimal, indicating a mostly straight path.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while gradually accelerating to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead (ID 3). The current lane is clear, and there are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop. The ego vehicle should maintain awareness of the surrounding vehicles, particularly those in the adjacent lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a steady speed as the vehicle accelerates.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 3.5 m/s to gradually increase speed while maintaining safety.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 2 for balanced control during straight driving.
