### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object IDs and Lanes:**
   - **Car (ID: 3):** In the same lane as the ego vehicle, directly ahead.
   - **Car (ID: 10):** In the same lane as the ego vehicle, directly ahead of Car ID 3.
   - **Car (ID: 1):** In the same lane as the ego vehicle, directly ahead of Car ID 10.
   - **Car (ID: 9):** In the adjacent lane to the left, moving parallel to the ego vehicle.

2. **Movements Relative to Ego:**
   - **Car (ID: 3):** Moving forward, maintaining a constant speed.
   - **Car (ID: 10):** Moving forward, maintaining a constant speed.
   - **Car (ID: 1):** Moving forward, maintaining a constant speed.
   - **Car (ID: 9):** Moving forward, maintaining a constant speed.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Decreasing from 4.7 m/s to 2.42 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration:** Increasing from 0.89 m/s² to 1.27 m/s².
- **Turn Angle:** Slightly decreasing from 6.16 degrees to -0.1 degrees, indicating a slight rightward adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop. The vehicles ahead are moving at a constant speed, and the lane is clear.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.42,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 2.42 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control.
