### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object 2 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Left lane, partially on the shoulder.
   - Movement: Stationary or moving very slowly.
   - Impact: Potential obstacle if ego vehicle continues straight.

2. **Object 4 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Moving forward.
   - Impact: No immediate threat but needs to be monitored.

3. **Object 6 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Moving forward.
   - Impact: No immediate threat but needs to be monitored.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- Speed: Increasing from 0.01 m/s to 2.43 m/s.
- Acceleration: Decreasing from 1.42 m/s² to 0.55 m/s².
- Turn Angle: Increasing right turn angle from 0.0° to -11.17°.
- Behavior: Ego vehicle is accelerating and turning slightly to the right.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED
- **Summary**: Continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. Monitor the stationary car on the left and ensure to stay in the right lane to avoid collision.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": -0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed while keeping an eye on the stationary car on the left. The vehicle should stay in the right lane to avoid any potential collision. The MPC parameters are set to maintain a smooth and safe driving experience.
