### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 2 (Bus)**:
   - **Lane**: Right lane.
   - **Movement**: The bus is stationary and partially blocking the right lane.
   - **Impact**: The bus is an obstacle that needs to be avoided. The ego vehicle should consider changing lanes to the left to bypass the bus.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with a slight decrease from 9.16 m/s to 9.0 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle's acceleration has been decreasing, indicating a gradual deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been relatively stable, indicating that the vehicle has been maintaining a straight path with minor adjustments.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: Change lane to the left to avoid the stationary bus.
- **Speed Adjustment**: Deceleration to ensure a safe lane change and avoid collision with the bus.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should change lanes to the left to bypass the stationary bus in the right lane. This maneuver should be done with caution, maintaining a safe speed and ensuring no other vehicles are in the left lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 7.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle maintains a desired speed after the lane change.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 to allow for smooth control during the lane change.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 7.0 m/s to decelerate slightly for a safe lane change.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the bus and any potential vehicles in the left lane.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.1 rad/s to facilitate a slight left turn for the lane change.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 to ensure smooth control during the lane change.
