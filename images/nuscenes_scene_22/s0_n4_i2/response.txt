### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Car 1**: Parked on the left side of the road, not in the driving lane.
2. **Car 2**: Moving in the same lane as the ego vehicle, approximately 10 meters ahead.
3. **Car 3**: Moving in the same lane as the ego vehicle, slightly ahead of Car 2.
4. **Car 4**: Moving in the same lane as the ego vehicle, slightly ahead of Car 3.
5. **Lane Line**: Solid white line indicating no overtaking.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 4.63 m/s to 5.41 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating the vehicle is speeding up.
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing, indicating a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The presence of the parked car on the left side of the road does not impact the driving lane. The moving cars ahead are within a safe distance, so no immediate action is required to change lanes or stop.

```

### Summary:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED
- **Conditions**: Maintain a safe distance from the moving cars ahead, and continue to monitor the parked car on the left side of the road. The ego vehicle should maintain a constant speed and slight left turn to stay in the lane.
