### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 9 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, stationary.
   - Position: Approximately 8-10 meters ahead on the right side of the road.
   - Movement: Stationary, no immediate threat to the ego vehicle.

2. **Object ID 11 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, stationary.
   - Position: Approximately 15 meters ahead on the right side of the road.
   - Movement: Stationary, no immediate threat to the ego vehicle.

3. **Object ID 10 and 12 (Lane lines)**:
   - Lane: Center lane markings.
   - Position: Clearly marked, guiding the vehicle to stay in the center of the lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with a slight increase from 8.59 m/s to 8.79 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been increasing slightly, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been consistent, indicating the vehicle is maintaining a steady course.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining its current speed and lane. The stationary cars on the right side of the road do not pose an immediate threat, so no lane change or deceleration is necessary at this moment.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 2,
  "desired_speed": 8.79,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 2 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 8.79 m/s, matching the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from any potential moving objects.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
