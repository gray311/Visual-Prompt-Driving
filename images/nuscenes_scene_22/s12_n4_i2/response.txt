### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 2 (Car)**: 
  - Location: In the same lane as the ego vehicle.
  - Distance: Approximately 10 meters ahead.
  - Movement: Stationary or moving very slowly.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 6.89 m/s to 8.6 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Decreasing from 1.17 m/s² to 0.8 m/s², indicating a gradual reduction in acceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight variations around 9 degrees, indicating a slight rightward orientation.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: DECELERATION to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead. There is no need for lane changes or stops as the road ahead is clear except for the car in the same lane.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a safe and steady speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Reduced to 5.0 m/s to decelerate and maintain a safe distance.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control during straight movement.
