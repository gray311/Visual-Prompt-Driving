### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Bus (ID: 2)**
   - Lane: Right lane, partially on the sidewalk.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact as it is parked off the main road.

2. **Car (ID: 9)**
   - Lane: Right lane, further down the road.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact as it is parked off the main road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been slightly decreasing over the past 4 seconds (from 9.0 m/s to 8.59 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been experiencing slight positive acceleration (from 0.35 m/s² to 0.51 m/s²).
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle's turn angle has been decreasing slightly (from 9.17 degrees to 8.94 degrees), indicating a slight rightward adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Move Forward**: Continue moving forward as the road ahead is clear.

#### Speed:
- **Constant Speed**: Maintain a constant speed as there are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles in the lane, and the parked bus and car on the right side do not pose a threat.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.59,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 8.59 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from any potential vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
