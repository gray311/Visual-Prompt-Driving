### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 5 (Car)**: 
  - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
  - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly ahead.
  - Distance: Approximately 10 meters ahead.

- **Object ID 2 (Car)**:
  - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
  - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly ahead.
  - Distance: Approximately 20 meters ahead.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 5.41 m/s to 6.89 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating the vehicle is speeding up.
- **Turn Angle**: Decreasing from 13.89 degrees to 9.75 degrees, indicating a slight correction towards a straighter path.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: DECELERATION to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead. Given the current speed and the presence of a vehicle approximately 10 meters ahead, it is prudent to reduce speed to avoid a potential collision.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a safe and reduced speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smoother control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Reduced to 4.0 m/s to safely approach the car ahead.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
