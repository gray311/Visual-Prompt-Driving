### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Notable Objects:**
  - **Car 3:** Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **Car 4:** Moving ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
  - **Cars 6, 7, 8:** Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **Other Cars (12, 14, 15, 16):** Parked on both sides of the road further ahead.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Increasing from 1.8 m/s to 4.53 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** Decreasing from 1.52 m/s² to 0.35 m/s².
- **Turn Angle:** Decreasing from 9.45° to 1.45°, indicating a slight rightward adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles in the lane, but the vehicle should be aware of the parked cars on both sides and the moving car ahead (Car 4).

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.53,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 4.53 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle should move straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control.
