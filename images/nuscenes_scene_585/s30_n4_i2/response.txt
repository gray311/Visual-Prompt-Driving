### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects Identified:**
  - **ID 8 (car)**: Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 13 (car)**: Moving ahead in the same lane.
  - **ID 14 (car)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **ID 15 (car)**: Moving ahead in the same lane.
  - **ID 17 (car)**: Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 18 (car)**: Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 21 (car)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **ID 4 (truck)**: Moving ahead in the same lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing over the last 4 seconds, indicating deceleration.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle's acceleration has been decreasing, indicating a gradual reduction in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been maintaining a slight left turn angle consistently.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while gradually accelerating to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The road is clear of immediate obstacles within the 10-meter radius, but the ego vehicle should be cautious of parked cars on both sides and the moving vehicles ahead.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (Moderate importance to maintain desired speed)
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (Low control effort for smoother acceleration)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (Moderate importance for safe following distance)
- **Desired Speed**: 2.5 m/s (Target speed to achieve safe and smooth forward movement)
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds (Safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0.0 rad/s (No turning required, maintain straight path)
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (Moderate weight for smooth control)
