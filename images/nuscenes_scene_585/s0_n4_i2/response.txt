### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Car)**: Initially in the left lane, moving out of the 10-meter radius.
- **Object 3 (Car)**: In the left lane, moving forward.
- **Object 4 (Car)**: In the right lane, moving forward.
- **Object 7 (Car)**: Appears in the last frame, in the left lane, moving forward.
- **Object 5 (Lane Line)**: Lane markings indicating the division between lanes.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds from 4.76 m/s to 3.2 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Varied, with a peak at 0.84 m/sÂ², indicating deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight right turn initially, then stabilizing.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed.
- Monitor the vehicles in the left and right lanes (Objects 3, 4, and 7).
- Ensure safe distance from the vehicles ahead.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a steady speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 3.5 m/s to maintain a safe and steady pace.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should move straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
