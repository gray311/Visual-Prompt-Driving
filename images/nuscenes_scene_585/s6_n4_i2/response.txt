### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Positions:**
  - **ID 3 (Car):** Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 4 (Car):** Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **ID 6 (Car):** Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 7 (Car):** Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 8 (Car):** Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 9 (Car):** Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 10 (Lane Line):** Lane line marking the boundary of the lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (from 3.2 m/s to 1.54 m/s).
- **Acceleration:** Varies, with a general trend of deceleration.
- **Turn Angle:** Slightly fluctuating, indicating minor adjustments in direction.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. There are parked cars on both sides of the road, but the lane ahead is clear. No immediate obstacles or traffic lights require stopping or significant speed adjustments.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 2,
  "desired_speed": 2.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain a steady speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 2 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 2.0 m/s to maintain a steady and safe speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from any potential moving vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for balanced control.
