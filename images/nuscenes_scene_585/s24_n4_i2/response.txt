### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Key Objects Identified:**
   - **Object 4 (Truck)**: Positioned in the center lane, approximately 20 meters ahead, moving slowly.
   - **Object 6 (Car)**: Parked on the left side of the road.
   - **Object 12 (Car)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
   - **Object 14, 15, 16 (Cars)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
   - **Object 7, 8 (Cars)**: Parked on the left side of the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds from 4.53 m/s to 2.21 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Increasing from 0.35 m/s² to 1.27 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly negative, indicating a slight leftward adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: ACCELERATION.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while accelerating to maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead (Object 4). Given the parked cars on both sides, the ego vehicle should stay centered in its lane and avoid any sudden lane changes.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a steady speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 3.5 m/s to gradually increase speed while maintaining safety.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the truck ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
