### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 3 (Car):** Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 4 (Car):** Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **ID 6, 7, 8, 9 (Cars):** Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **ID 10 (Lane Line):** Indicates the lane boundary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has varied between 0.58 m/s and 1.8 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle's acceleration has been positive, indicating an increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been making slight turns, with a maximum turn angle of 9.45 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining awareness of the parked vehicles on both sides of the road. Given the navigation command to keep forward and the absence of immediate obstacles in the lane, the vehicle should accelerate to a safe cruising speed.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a steady speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 2.0 m/s to achieve a safe cruising speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from any potential moving vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for balanced control.
