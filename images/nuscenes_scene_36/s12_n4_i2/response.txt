### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Center lane.
   - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a consistent position relative to the ego vehicle.
2. **Object ID 6 (Construction Cones)**:
   - Lane: Left side of the road.
   - Movement: Stationary.
3. **Object ID 7 (Lane Line)**:
   - Lane: Center lane.
   - Movement: Stationary, marking the lane boundaries.
4. **Object ID 8 (Lane Line)**:
   - Lane: Center lane.
   - Movement: Stationary, marking the lane boundaries.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- Speed: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing slightly over the last 4 seconds (from 8.14 m/s to 9.43 m/s).
- Acceleration: The acceleration has been decreasing, indicating a gradual stabilization of speed.
- Turn Angle: The turn angle has remained relatively constant, suggesting the vehicle is maintaining a steady course.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **MOVE FORWARD**: Continue moving forward along the road.

#### Speed:
- **CONSTANT SPEED**: Maintain a constant speed to ensure smooth driving and avoid sudden changes.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining its current lane. The vehicle ahead is maintaining a consistent position, so there is no immediate need for lane changes or stops. The construction cones on the left side of the road do not pose a threat to the current path.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 9.43,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the current speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 9.43 m/s, matching the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
