### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 1 (Car)**:
  - **Location**: In the same lane as the ego vehicle, approximately 8-10 meters ahead.
  - **Movement**: Moving forward at a similar speed to the ego vehicle.

#### Traffic Light:
- **Status**: No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing gradually from 7.97 m/s to 8.43 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Decreasing from 2.61 m/s² to 1.48 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing left turn angle from -6.99° to -48.71°.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The car ahead is in the same lane and moving at a similar speed, so no immediate lane change or stop is required. The road curves to the left, and the ego vehicle should follow the curve while maintaining a safe distance from the car ahead.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.43,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed while turning.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smoother control during the turn.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 8.43 m/s to match the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.1 rad/s for a slight left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control during the turn.
