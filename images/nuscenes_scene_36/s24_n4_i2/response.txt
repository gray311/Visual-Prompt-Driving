### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 1 (Car)**: 
  - Lane: Right lane, moving forward.
  - Movement: The car is moving forward along the curved road, maintaining a steady distance from the ego vehicle.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing slightly over the past 4 seconds (from 8.93 m/s to 7.97 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been increasing, indicating the vehicle is preparing to slow down or adjust its speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been decreasing, indicating the vehicle is navigating a right curve.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward along the curved road, maintaining a constant speed. There is a car ahead in the right lane, but it is maintaining a steady distance, so no immediate action is required other than to keep a safe following distance and be aware of the surroundings.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": -0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a desired speed while navigating the curve.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smoother control during the curve.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 8.0 m/s, which is a slight reduction from the initial speed to navigate the curve safely.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to -0.1 rad/s to navigate the right curve.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control during the curve.
