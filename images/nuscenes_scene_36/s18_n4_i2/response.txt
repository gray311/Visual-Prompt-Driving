### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Car)**:
  - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
  - Movement: Moving forward, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle.
  - Impact: The car is within the 10-meter radius and is moving in the same direction. It is important to maintain a safe distance.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has slightly decreased from 9.43 m/s to 8.93 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has increased from 0.25 m/s² to 0.65 m/s², indicating a deceleration phase.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has increased from 26.83 degrees to 28.96 degrees, indicating a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION
- **Summary**: The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a safe distance from the car ahead. Given the slight left turn and the presence of the car ahead, it is advisable to decelerate slightly to ensure a safe following distance.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead. The slight left turn should be managed smoothly by adjusting the yaw rate. The MPC parameters are set to ensure a balance between speed maintenance, control effort, and safe headway.
