### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Car)**: 
  - Lane: Left lane.
  - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a steady speed.
- **Object 2 (Truck)**: 
  - Lane: Left lane.
  - Movement: Stationary.
- **Object 4 (Car)**: 
  - Lane: Left lane.
  - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a steady speed.
- **Lane Lines**: 
  - Lane line 3: Solid white line on the right side.
  - Lane line 5: Solid yellow line on the left side.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 4.81 m/s to 6.42 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating an increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing, indicating a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The ego vehicle should be aware of the stationary truck (Object 2) on the left lane and the moving cars (Objects 1 and 4) ahead. There is no need to change lanes as the right lane is clear and the left lane has a solid yellow line, indicating no overtaking.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 6.42,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED.
- **Conditions**: Maintain awareness of surrounding vehicles, especially the stationary truck on the left lane. Continue moving forward while adhering to the lane markings and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.
