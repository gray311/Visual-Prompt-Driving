### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object IDs and Lanes**:
   - **ID 1 (Car)**: In the same lane as ego, directly ahead.
   - **ID 6 (Car)**: In the adjacent lane to the right.
   - **ID 9 (Car)**: In the adjacent lane to the right.
   - **ID 11 (Lane Line)**: Lane marking on the right.
   - **ID 12 (Car)**: In the adjacent lane to the left.
   - **ID 13 (Car)**: In the adjacent lane to the right.
   - **ID 14 (Car)**: In the same lane as ego, directly ahead.
   - **ID 15 (Lane Line)**: Lane marking on the left.

2. **Movements Relative to Ego**:
   - **ID 1 (Car)**: Moving forward, slowing down.
   - **ID 6 (Car)**: Moving forward, maintaining speed.
   - **ID 9 (Car)**: Moving forward, maintaining speed.
   - **ID 12 (Car)**: Moving forward, maintaining speed.
   - **ID 13 (Car)**: Moving forward, maintaining speed.
   - **ID 14 (Car)**: Moving forward, slowing down.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with minor fluctuations around 5 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly, with values around 1 m/sÂ².
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been making slight turns, with angles ranging from -4.07 to 4.19 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to maintain a safe distance from the car directly ahead (ID 1 and ID 14). Given the navigation command to keep forward and be aware of surrounding vehicles, the ego vehicle should maintain its lane and adjust speed as necessary to avoid collision.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 4,
  "desired_speed": 4.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 4 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.5 m/s to decelerate slightly.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the ego vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
