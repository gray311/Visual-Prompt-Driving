### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 1 (Red Car):** In the left lane, stationary or moving slowly.
  - **ID 6 (Green Car):** In the left lane, moving slowly.
  - **ID 7 (Green Car):** In the left lane, moving slowly.
  - **ID 9 (Green Car):** In the left lane, moving slowly.
  - **ID 8 (Lane Line):** Marking the right boundary of the lane.
  - **ID 11 (Lane Line):** Marking the right boundary of the lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Increasing gradually from 3.65 m/s to 4.99 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** Positive, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** Slightly negative, indicating a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The road is clear ahead, and the lane markings are visible. The surrounding vehicles are in the left lane and do not pose an immediate threat.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 5.0 m/s to maintain a constant speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control.
