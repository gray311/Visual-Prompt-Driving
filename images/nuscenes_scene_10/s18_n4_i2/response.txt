### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 8 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Same as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Moving forward, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - Impact: The car is in the same lane and moving forward, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance.

2. **Object ID 11 (Lane Line)**:
   - Lane: Indicates the boundary of the lane.
   - Movement: Static.
   - Impact: Helps in maintaining lane discipline.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively stable, with a slight decrease from 5.53 m/s to 5.08 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been positive, indicating a slight increase in speed over the last 4 seconds.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been increasing, suggesting a gradual turn to the left.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a safe distance from the car ahead (Object ID 8). Given the slight left turn indicated by the increasing turn angle, the vehicle should ensure it stays within the lane boundaries.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (Moderate importance to maintain desired speed)
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (Low value for smoother control during the slight turn)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (Moderate importance for maintaining safe following distance)
- **Desired Speed**: 5.0 m/s (Maintain current speed)
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds (Safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0.1 rad/s (Slight left turn)
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (Moderate weight for smoother control)
