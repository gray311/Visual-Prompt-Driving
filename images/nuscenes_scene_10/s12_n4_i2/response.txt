### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 8 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly.
   - Distance: Approximately 10 meters ahead.

2. **Object ID 9 (Lane Line)**:
   - Lane: Clearly marked lane line on the right side.
   - Movement: Static.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing gradually from 4.21 m/s to 5.29 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive but decreasing, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly fluctuating around 38 degrees, indicating a slight curve or lane adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The vehicle ahead (Object ID 8) is approximately 10 meters away, so maintaining a safe following distance is crucial. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.29,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed efficiently.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.29 m/s, matching the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
