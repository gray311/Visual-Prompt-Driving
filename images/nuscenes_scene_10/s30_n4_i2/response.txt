### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object 1 (Red Car)**:
   - Lane: Rightmost lane, parked on the side.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact as it is parked.

2. **Object 12 (Blue Car)**:
   - Lane: Rightmost lane, moving forward.
   - Movement: Moving forward, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - Impact: Needs to be monitored for maintaining safe distance.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant with slight fluctuations, indicating a stable forward movement.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration values show a slight increase, suggesting the vehicle is maintaining or slightly increasing its speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle indicates the vehicle is navigating a slight curve to the right.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a safe distance from the blue car ahead. The parked red car does not pose any immediate threat. The ego vehicle should stay in its lane and be prepared to adjust speed if the blue car slows down or stops.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.7,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": -0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a steady speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 to allow for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.7 m/s to maintain current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the blue car.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to -0.1 rad/s to account for the slight right curve.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 2 for balanced control.
