### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object IDs and Lanes:**
   - **ID 4 (Car):** In the left lane, stationary.
   - **ID 5 (Car):** In the left lane, stationary.
   - **ID 6 (Car):** In the right lane, stationary.
   - **ID 8 (Car):** In the left lane, stationary.
   - **ID 9 (Lane Line):** Marking the boundary of the lanes.

2. **Traffic Light:**
   - No traffic light is visible in the frames.

3. **Ego Analysis:**
   - **Speed:** Increasing from 2.28 m/s to 4.21 m/s.
   - **Acceleration:** Positive, indicating an increase in speed.
   - **Turn Angle:** Increasing from 21.97° to 37.26°, indicating a leftward turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The left lane is occupied by stationary vehicles, so the ego vehicle should stay in the right lane to avoid collisions. The turn angle indicates a slight leftward adjustment, which should be corrected to maintain a straight path.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.21,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
- **Behavior:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed:** CONSTANT SPEED
- **Conditions:** Maintain a straight path in the right lane, avoiding stationary vehicles in the left lane. Adjust turn angle to correct the leftward drift.
