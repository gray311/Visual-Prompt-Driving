### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object IDs and Lanes:**
   - **Object ID 8 (Car):** Initially in the right lane, moving forward.
   - **Object ID 1 (Car):** Appears in the right lane, moving forward.
   - **Object ID 12 (Car):** Appears in the right lane, moving forward.

2. **Traffic Light:**
   - No traffic light is visible in the frames.

3. **Ego Analysis:**
   - **Speed:** Decreasing slightly over the last 4 seconds (from 5.08 m/s to 4.63 m/s).
   - **Acceleration:** Minor fluctuations, generally positive.
   - **Turn Angle:** Slightly decreasing, indicating a slight turn to the right.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The surrounding vehicles are in the right lane, and there is no immediate need to change lanes or stop. The ego vehicle should be cautious of the vehicles in the right lane and maintain a safe distance.
