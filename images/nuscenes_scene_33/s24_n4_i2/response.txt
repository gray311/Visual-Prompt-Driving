### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 4 (Car)**:
  - **Lane**: The car is in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
  - **Movement**: The car is stationary or moving very slowly on the shoulder of the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing over the last 4 seconds from 7.1 m/s to 5.37 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been positive but decreasing, indicating a gradual deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has varied, indicating slight steering adjustments, with a notable left turn in the last second.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION
- **Summary**: The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to maintain a safe distance from the stationary car on the shoulder. The vehicle should stay in its lane and be prepared to steer slightly left to avoid the stationary car if necessary.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a safe speed while decelerating.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.0 m/s to continue decelerating safely.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the stationary car.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.1 rad/s to allow for slight left steering adjustments.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control during slight steering adjustments.
