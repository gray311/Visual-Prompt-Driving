### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (car)**: Detected in the first frame, located in the left lane, moving forward.
- **Object 2 (loneline)**: Detected in the first frame, marking the lane boundary.
- **Object 3 (car)**: Detected in the last frame, located in the left lane, moving forward.
- **Object 4 (car)**: Detected in the last frame, located in the left lane, moving forward.
- **Object 5 (loneline)**: Detected in the last frame, marking the lane boundary.
- **Object 6 (loneline)**: Detected in the last frame, marking the lane boundary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights detected in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been gradually increasing from 9.07 m/s to 9.51 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been relatively stable, indicating a smooth increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been decreasing, indicating a gradual right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The road ahead is clear with no immediate obstacles within a 10-meter radius. The detected vehicles are in the left lane and do not pose an immediate threat. The ego vehicle should stay in its lane and continue forward, adhering to the navigation command.

### MPC Control Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 2,
  "desired_speed": 9.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 2 for a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 9.5 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
