### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 3 (Car)**: Parked on the left side of the road, not in the driving lane.
- **Object 4 (Car)**: Moving ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, approximately 20 meters ahead.
- **Objects 6, 5, 9 (Lane Lines)**: Clearly marked lane lines indicating the boundaries of the driving lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with minor fluctuations around 9.6 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly, with the highest acceleration at 0.82 m/sÂ².
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been straightening out from a left turn, with the turn angle decreasing from -9.4 degrees to -0.12 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed, maintaining awareness of the moving car ahead (Object 4). The parked car (Object 3) on the left side does not pose an immediate threat. The lane lines are clearly marked, and the ego vehicle should stay within its lane.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 9.6,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed efficiently.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 9.6 m/s to match the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
