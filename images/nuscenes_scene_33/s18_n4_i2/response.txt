### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object 4 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a steady speed.
   - Distance: Approximately 10 meters ahead of the ego vehicle.

2. **Object 7 and 8 (Cars)**:
   - Lane: Parked on the left side of the road, not in the driving lane.
   - Movement: Stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing over the past 4 seconds from 9.56 m/s to 7.1 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating, with acceleration increasing from 0.82 m/s² to 1.63 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been making slight left turns, with the turn angle increasing from -0.12 degrees to 2.29 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**:  DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead (Object 4). The road is clear, and there are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights. The parked cars on the left do not pose a threat as they are stationary and off the driving lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smoother control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 9.0 m/s to match the road conditions and maintain a safe distance from Object 4.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 2 for smoother control.
