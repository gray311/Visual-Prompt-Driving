### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Car)**: 
  - Lane: Right lane, ahead of the ego vehicle.
  - Movement: The car is moving forward along the road, maintaining a consistent position relative to the ego vehicle.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing slightly over the last 4 seconds, from 8.33 m/s to 9.07 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has varied, with a peak of 1.16 m/s² and a recent decrease to 0.41 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been turning right, with the turn angle increasing from 0.0 degrees to -18.14 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward along the road, maintaining a constant speed. The road curves to the right, so the vehicle should continue to follow the lane markings and be aware of the car ahead. No immediate stops or lane changes are necessary.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 9.07,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.5,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed as the vehicle navigates the curve.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 9.07 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to -0.5 rad/s to follow the right curve of the road.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control during the turn.
