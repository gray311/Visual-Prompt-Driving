### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes**:
  - **ID 4 (Bus)**: In the right lane, stationary.
  - **ID 5 (Bus)**: In the left lane, stationary.
  - **ID 2 (Car)**: In the left lane, stationary.
  - **ID 3 (Bus)**: In the left lane, stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing over the last 4 seconds from 8.2 m/s to 5.84 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle's acceleration has been relatively stable, with minor fluctuations.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been making a slight right turn, indicated by the negative turn angles.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating to maintain a safe distance from the stationary vehicles in the left lane. The right lane is clear, so the ego vehicle can proceed without changing lanes.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": -0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a safe speed while decelerating.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smoother control during deceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from the stationary vehicles.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 3.0 m/s to safely navigate past the stationary vehicles.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to -0.1 rad/s to continue the slight right turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control during the maneuver.
