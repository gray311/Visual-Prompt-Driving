### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object 1 (Car)**:
   - **Location**: Directly ahead in the left lane.
   - **Movement**: Stationary at the red light.
   
2. **Object 2 (Car)**:
   - **Location**: Directly ahead in the middle lane.
   - **Movement**: Stationary at the red light.
   
3. **Object 3 (Car)**:
   - **Location**: Directly ahead in the right lane.
   - **Movement**: Stationary at the red light.
   
4. **Object 4 (Car)**:
   - **Location**: Further ahead in the right lane.
   - **Movement**: Stationary at the red light.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle has been stationary for the last 4 seconds (0.0 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Slight positive acceleration (0.21 m/sÂ²), indicating readiness to move.
- **Turn Angle**: Minimal change in turn angle, indicating the vehicle is aligned straight.

### Driving Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: STOP
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED (0 m/s)

#### Summary:
Given the red traffic light and the stationary vehicles ahead in all lanes, the ego vehicle should remain stopped. There is no immediate need to change lanes or turn, as the traffic light is red and the vehicles ahead are not moving.

### MPC Signals:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 1
- **R (Control Effort)**: 3 (Moderate control effort to maintain readiness to move when the light changes)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 5 (High priority on maintaining a safe distance from the stationary vehicles ahead)
- **Desired Speed**: 0 m/s (Remain stationary)
- **Desired Headway**: 2 seconds (Maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead)
- **Desired_yaw_rate**: 0 rad/s (No turning required)
- **Yaw_rate_weight**: 3 (Moderate weight to ensure stability while stationary)

### Final Output:
- **Grounded Reasoning**:
  - **Object Analysis**: Identified four stationary cars ahead at the red light.
  - **Ego Analysis**: Ego vehicle is stationary with slight positive acceleration and minimal turn angle.

- **Driving Plan**:
  - **Behavior**: STOP
  - **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED (0 m/s)
  - **Summary**: Remain stopped at the red light, maintaining a safe distance from the stationary vehicles ahead.

- **MPC Signals**: [1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 0, 3]
