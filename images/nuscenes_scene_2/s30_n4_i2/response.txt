### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 20**: A pedestrian crossing the street from left to right. Initially in the middle of the crosswalk and moving towards the right side of the road.
2. **Object ID 15**: Another pedestrian crossing the street from left to right. Initially closer to the left side of the crosswalk and moving towards the right side of the road.
3. **Object ID 21**: A pedestrian pushing a cart, crossing the street from right to left. Initially on the right side of the crosswalk and moving towards the left side of the road.
4. **Object ID 22**: A pedestrian crossing the street from left to right. Initially in the middle of the crosswalk and moving towards the right side of the road.

#### Ego Analysis:
- The ego vehicle has been stationary for the last 4 seconds with a speed of 0.0 m/s.
- The acceleration values are slightly decreasing, indicating a stable stationary state.
- The turn angle is negligible, suggesting the vehicle is facing straight ahead.

### Driving Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: STOP
- **Speed**: DECELERATION TO ZERO

#### Summary:
Given the presence of multiple pedestrians actively crossing the street in front of the ego vehicle, it is crucial to remain stationary to ensure their safety. The traffic light is red, reinforcing the need to stop. The pedestrians are within a 10-meter radius and directly in the intended path of the ego vehicle.

### MPC Signals:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 1
- **R (Control Effort)**: 3 (Moderate control effort to maintain a smooth stop)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 4 (High priority to maintain a safe distance from pedestrians)
- **Desired Speed**: 0.0 m/s (Since the vehicle is stopping)
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds (Maintain a safe distance from pedestrians)
- **Desired_yaw_rate**: 0.0 rad/s (No turning required)
- **Yaw_rate_weight**: 3 (Moderate weight to ensure stability)

### Conclusion:
The ego vehicle should remain stationary, ensuring the safety of the pedestrians crossing the street. The MPC control signals are set to maintain this stationary state with a focus on safety and stability.
