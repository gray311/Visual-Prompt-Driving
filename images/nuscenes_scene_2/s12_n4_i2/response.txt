### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 5 (Bus)**:
   - Location: Initially blocking the intersection, then moves out of the way.
   - Movement: Stationary at first, then moves to the right.

2. **Object ID 6 (Car)**:
   - Location: Initially behind the bus, then moves forward.
   - Movement: Moves forward and stops at the intersection.

3. **Object ID 8 (Car)**:
   - Location: Initially behind the bus, then moves forward.
   - Movement: Moves forward and stops at the intersection.

4. **Object ID 9 (Car)**:
   - Location: Initially on the left side of the intersection, then moves forward.
   - Movement: Moves forward and stops at the intersection.

5. **Object ID 13 (Car)**:
   - Location: Initially on the left side of the intersection, then moves forward.
   - Movement: Moves forward and stops at the intersection.

#### Ego Analysis:
- The ego vehicle has been stationary for the past 4 seconds with a speed of 0.0 m/s.
- There is a slight acceleration observed, but it remains constant.
- The turn angle remains at 0.0 degrees, indicating no change in direction.

### Driving Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
The ego vehicle should move forward as the bus (Object ID 5) has cleared the intersection. The other cars (Object IDs 6, 8, 9, and 13) are stationary and not obstructing the path. The traffic light is red, so the ego vehicle should proceed with caution and be prepared to stop if necessary.

### MPC Signals:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 1
- **R (Control Effort)**: 3 (Moderate control effort for smooth acceleration)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (Moderate weight to maintain a safe distance)
- **Desired Speed**: 5 m/s (Moderate speed to move forward cautiously)
- **Desired Headway**: 2 seconds (Maintain a safe distance from any potential moving objects)
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 rad/s (Straight-line motion)
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (Moderate weight for smooth control)

### Final Output:
- **Grounded Reasoning**:
  - **Object Analysis**: Objects 5, 6, 8, 9, and 13 are identified as key objects. The bus (Object ID 5) has moved out of the way, and the other cars are stationary.
  - **Ego Analysis**: The ego vehicle has been stationary with slight acceleration and no change in direction.

- **Driving Plan**:
  - **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
  - **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED
  - **Summary**: The ego vehicle should move forward cautiously as the intersection is clear of immediate obstacles, but be prepared to stop if necessary due to the red traffic light.

- **MPC Signals**: [1, 3, 3, 5, 2, 0, 3]
