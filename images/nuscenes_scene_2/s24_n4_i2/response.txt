### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 15 (Pedestrian)**:
   - Location: Center-left of the crosswalk.
   - Movement: Walking from left to right across the crosswalk.
   - Impact: Directly in the path of the ego-vehicle.

2. **Object ID 18 (Pedestrian)**:
   - Location: Center of the crosswalk.
   - Movement: Walking from left to right across the crosswalk.
   - Impact: Directly in the path of the ego-vehicle.

3. **Object ID 14 (Pedestrian)**:
   - Location: Right side of the crosswalk.
   - Movement: Walking from left to right across the crosswalk.
   - Impact: Directly in the path of the ego-vehicle.

4. **Object ID 19 (Car)**:
   - Location: Right side of the intersection.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: Not directly in the path but should be monitored.

5. **Object ID 21 (Pedestrian)**:
   - Location: Far right of the crosswalk.
   - Movement: Walking from right to left across the crosswalk.
   - Impact: Directly in the path of the ego-vehicle.

#### Ego Analysis:
- The ego vehicle has been stationary for the past 4 seconds with a constant speed of 0.0 m/s and a slight acceleration of 0.22 m/sÂ².
- The turn angle has remained constant at 0.0 degrees, indicating no change in direction.
- The presence of multiple pedestrians crossing the road in front of the ego-vehicle necessitates maintaining a stationary position to ensure safety.

### Driving Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: STOP
- **Speed**: DECELERATION TO ZERO

#### Summary:
Given the presence of multiple pedestrians crossing the road directly in front of the ego-vehicle, the safest course of action is to remain stationary until the crosswalk is clear. This ensures the safety of the pedestrians and compliance with traffic regulations.

### MPC Signals:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 1
- **R (Control Effort)**: 3 (Moderate control effort to maintain smooth stopping)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 5 (High priority on maintaining safe distance from pedestrians)
- **Desired Speed**: 0.0 m/s (Stationary)
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds (Safe distance from pedestrians)
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0.0 rad/s (No change in direction)
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (Moderate weight for smooth control)

This plan ensures the ego-vehicle remains stationary until the crosswalk is clear, prioritizing pedestrian safety and adhering to traffic regulations.
