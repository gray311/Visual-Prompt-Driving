### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 2 (Car)**: Initially in the right lane, moving towards the left lane.
- **Object 5 (Car)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
- **Object 15 (Car)**: Far ahead in the same lane as ego.
- **Lane Lines**: Clearly marked, with a speed hump ahead.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing over the last 4 seconds (4.25 m/s to 5.84 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating acceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: Varying, indicating slight steering adjustments.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- **Overall Driving Plan**: Continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to navigate the speed hump safely. Maintain awareness of the car (Object 2) moving into the left lane and ensure a safe distance from the parked car (Object 5) on the right side.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure a smooth deceleration to the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for a moderate control effort, allowing for smooth adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.0 m/s to safely navigate the speed hump.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
