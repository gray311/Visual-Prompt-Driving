### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 15 (car)**: 
  - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
  - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a consistent distance.
- **Object 19 (lane line)**:
  - Lane: Right lane line.
  - Movement: Stationary.
- **Object 20 (lane line)**:
  - Lane: Right lane line.
  - Movement: Stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 5.84 m/s to 6.51 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Generally positive, indicating a slight increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Minor adjustments, indicating a mostly straight path with slight corrections.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: DECELERATION to account for the speed hump ahead.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to safely navigate the speed hump. Maintain awareness of the car ahead and ensure a safe following distance.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle maintains a steady speed after deceleration.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.0 m/s to slow down for the speed hump.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 2 for balanced control.
