### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object 1 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Same as ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly.
   - Impact: Directly in front of the ego vehicle, requiring attention to avoid collision.

2. **Object 2 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Adjacent lane to the right.
   - Movement: Moving forward.
   - Impact: No immediate impact on the ego vehicle's lane but should be monitored.

3. **Object 5 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Parked on the right side of the road.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact on the ego vehicle's lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has varied, with a notable increase to 1.91 m/s in the last second.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating consistently.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has a slight left turn angle initially, followed by a significant right turn angle (-8.06 degrees).

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: DECELERATION to avoid collision with the car directly ahead.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward but decelerate to maintain a safe distance from the car directly ahead (Object 1). Monitor the adjacent lane for any potential lane changes by Object 2.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 1.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (Moderate importance to maintain desired speed while decelerating).
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.2 (Moderate control effort for smooth deceleration).
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (Moderate importance to maintain a safe following distance).
- **Desired Speed**: 1.0 m/s (Reduced speed to avoid collision).
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds (Safe following distance).
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 rad/s (No turning required).
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (Moderate weight for smooth control).
