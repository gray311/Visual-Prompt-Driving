### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Car)**: 
  - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
  - Movement: Stationary or moving very slowly.
- **Object 2 (Car)**: 
  - Lane: Adjacent lane to the right.
  - Movement: Stationary or moving very slowly.
- **Object 5 (Car)**: 
  - Lane: Adjacent lane to the right.
  - Movement: Stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds from 5.33 m/s to 1.47 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight increase, indicating a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating to maintain a safe distance from the stationary car (Object 1) in the same lane. The ego vehicle should be cautious of the surrounding vehicles and maintain lane discipline.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 1.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a desired speed while decelerating.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smoother control during deceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 1.5 m/s to continue moving forward cautiously.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.1 rad/s to account for the slight left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control during the slight turn.
