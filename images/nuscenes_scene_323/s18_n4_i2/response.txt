### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Car 1 (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Left lane, parked on the side.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact as it is parked.

2. **Car 2 (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: Left lane, ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - Movement: Moving forward.
   - Impact: Requires maintaining a safe following distance.

3. **Car 5 (ID: 5)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, parked on the side.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact as it is parked.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 1.91 m/s to 4.25 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Negative values indicate a leftward turn, but the angle is decreasing, suggesting a return to a straight path.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED.

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward while maintaining a safe distance from Car 2.
- Monitor the parked cars (Car 1 and Car 5) to ensure they remain stationary.
- Follow the navigation command to keep forward along the road.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.25,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from Car 2.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.25 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
