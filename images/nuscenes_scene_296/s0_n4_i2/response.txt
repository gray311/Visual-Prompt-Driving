### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Pedestrian (ID: 1)**: 
  - Location: Crosswalk, moving from left to right across the road.
  - Impact: High, as the pedestrian is in the crosswalk and must be yielded to.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 1.49 m/s to 4.83 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Generally positive, indicating increasing speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing from 0.0 to 43.01 degrees, indicating a right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **STOP**: Due to the pedestrian crossing the road.

#### Speed:
- **DECELERATION TO ZERO**: To ensure the pedestrian can safely cross.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle needs to stop to allow the pedestrian to cross safely. Once the pedestrian has crossed, the vehicle can resume moving forward.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 0,
  "desired_headway": 1.5,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed once the vehicle resumes movement.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control during deceleration and stopping.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance once the vehicle resumes movement.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0 to stop the vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 1.5 seconds for safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is stopping.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control during stopping.
