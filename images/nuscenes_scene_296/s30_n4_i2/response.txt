### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Types**:
  - **ID 2**: Car, located in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
  - **ID 5**: Car, located in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
  - **ID 9**: Car, located in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
  - **ID 8 and 10**: Lane lines, marking the boundaries of the lane.

- **Object Movements**:
  - **ID 2, 5, 9**: These cars are ahead of the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing slightly over the last 4 seconds (from 7.58 m/s to 6.82 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been decelerating slightly.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle is maintaining a relatively straight path with a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD

#### Speed:
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop. The ego vehicle should be aware of the cars ahead and maintain a safe following distance.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 6.82,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 6.82 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
