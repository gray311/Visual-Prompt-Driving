### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 2 (Car)**: 
  - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
  - Movement: Stationary or moving very slowly.
  - Distance: Approximately 10 meters ahead.
- **Object ID 5 (Car)**: 
  - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
  - Movement: Stationary or moving very slowly.
  - Distance: Approximately 10 meters ahead.
- **Object ID 7 (Lane Line)**: 
  - Lane: Right lane line marking.
- **Object ID 8 (Lane Line)**: 
  - Lane: Left lane line marking.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with a slight decrease from 7.94 m/s to 7.58 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been experiencing slight positive acceleration, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been decreasing slightly, indicating a slight rightward adjustment in the vehicle's orientation.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The vehicles ahead are approximately 10 meters away and appear to be stationary or moving very slowly. The ego vehicle should be prepared to decelerate if the distance to the vehicles ahead decreases significantly.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 7.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a steady speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 7.5 m/s, slightly lower than the current speed to account for the vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
