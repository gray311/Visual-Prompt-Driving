### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 2 (Car)**: Located in the same lane as the ego vehicle, approximately 10 meters ahead.
- **Object 3 (Car)**: Located in the same lane as the ego vehicle, approximately 5 meters ahead.
- **Object 4 (Lane Line)**: Indicates the lane boundaries.
- **Object 5 (Car)**: Located further ahead in the same lane, approximately 15 meters ahead.
- **Object 6 (Lane Line)**: Indicates the lane boundaries.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with a slight decrease from 7.16 m/s to 7.03 m/s over the past 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has experienced minor fluctuations in acceleration, indicating slight adjustments in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has maintained a relatively stable turn angle, suggesting it is moving straight with minor adjustments.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION

#### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to maintain a safe distance from the car directly ahead (Object 3). Given the current speed and the proximity of the vehicles ahead, maintaining a safe following distance is crucial.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 6.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle maintains a desired speed while decelerating.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to prioritize maintaining a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 6.0 m/s to decelerate slightly and maintain a safe distance.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
