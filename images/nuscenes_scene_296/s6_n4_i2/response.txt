### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (ID: 2)**: Car, located in the same lane as the ego vehicle, approximately 8 meters ahead.
- **Object 2 (ID: 3)**: Car, located in the same lane as the ego vehicle, approximately 15 meters ahead.
- **Object 3 (ID: 4)**: Lane line, marking the boundary of the lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing over the past 4 seconds, from 4.83 m/s to 7.16 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been decreasing, indicating a gradual reduction in the rate of speed increase.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been increasing, indicating the vehicle is making a right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The vehicle should be aware of the cars ahead and maintain a safe following distance. Given the current speed and the distance to the vehicles ahead, no immediate deceleration is required, but the vehicle should be prepared to adjust speed if the distance to the car ahead decreases.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 7.16,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to the current speed of 7.16 m/s.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 2 for smoother control.
