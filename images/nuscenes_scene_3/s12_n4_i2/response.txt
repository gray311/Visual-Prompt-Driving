### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Notable Objects:**
  - **ID 13 (car)**: Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 19 (car)**: Moving forward in the same lane as ego, approximately 30 meters ahead.
  - **ID 26 (car)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **ID 27, 28, 29 (cars)**: Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 30 (bus)**: Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 31 (bus)**: Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **ID 32, 34, 35, 36 (lane lines)**: Marking the lanes on the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with a slight increase from 8.04 m/s to 8.5 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly, with a consistent acceleration of 0.64 m/sÂ² in the last two seconds.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been making minor adjustments to its direction, with a slight left turn initially and then a slight right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward, maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles in the lane, and the parked vehicles on the sides do not pose a threat. The vehicle ahead (ID 19) is far enough to not require immediate action.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will maintain its current speed and continue moving forward. The parked cars and buses on the sides of the road do not pose an immediate threat. The vehicle ahead (ID 19) is at a safe distance, so no deceleration is required. The ego vehicle will keep a constant speed and monitor the surroundings for any changes.
