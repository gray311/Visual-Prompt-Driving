### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object 19 (Bus)**:
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: The bus is parked on the right side, not obstructing the ego vehicle's lane.

2. **Object 42 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Left lane.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: The car is parked on the left side, not obstructing the ego vehicle's lane.

3. **Object 29 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Left lane.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: The car is parked on the left side, not obstructing the ego vehicle's lane.

4. **Object 41 (Car)**:
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: The car is parked on the right side, not obstructing the ego vehicle's lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has increased from 6.53 m/s to 8.29 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has decreased from 1.11 m/s² to 0.38 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has slightly decreased, indicating a minor correction to maintain a straight path.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward along the road, maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles in the lane, and the parked vehicles on both sides do not pose a threat. The navigation command to keep forward and be aware of surrounding vehicles is adhered to.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.29,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (to maintain the desired speed effectively).
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (for smooth control).
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (to maintain a safe following distance).
- **Desired Speed**: 8.29 m/s (current speed).
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds (safe following distance).
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 rad/s (no turning required).
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (for smooth control).
