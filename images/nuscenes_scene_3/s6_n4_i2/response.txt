### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects Identified:**
  - **Cars:** IDs 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29
  - **Buses:** IDs 13, 17, 30
  - **Lane Lines:** IDs 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 32, 34

- **Lanes and Movements:**
  - **Cars (IDs 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29):** Parked on the side of the road.
  - **Buses (IDs 13, 17, 30):** Parked on the side of the road.
  - **Lane Lines (IDs 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 32, 34):** Clearly marked, indicating no overtaking zones and lane boundaries.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with minor fluctuations around 8.36 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** Minor positive acceleration, indicating a slight increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** Small turn angles, indicating slight adjustments to maintain lane position.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop. The parked vehicles and buses on the side of the road do not pose a threat to the current lane of travel.

### MPC Signals:

  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.2 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 8.36 m/s to match the current speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds for safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 for straight movement.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control.
