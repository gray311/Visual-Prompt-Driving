### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object IDs and Lanes:**
   - **Object 12 (car):** In the right lane, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Object 13 (car):** In the right lane, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Object 14 (car):** In the right lane, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Object 15 (car):** In the right lane, moving away from the ego vehicle.

2. **Movements Relative to Ego:**
   - **Object 12, 13, 14:** Approaching the ego vehicle, indicating oncoming traffic.
   - **Object 15:** Moving away from the ego vehicle, indicating it is ahead in the same direction.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing slightly over the past 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration:** The acceleration has been relatively stable, indicating a smooth increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The turn angle has been decreasing, indicating the ego vehicle is straightening out from a turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed. The road has a double solid line, indicating no overtaking is allowed. The ego vehicle should maintain its lane and be cautious of the oncoming traffic (Objects 12, 13, 14). The road is curving, so maintaining a steady speed and lane position is crucial.

### MPC Control Signals:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** 1
- **R (Control Effort):** 3 (for smoother control)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** 3 (to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead)
- **Desired Speed:** 7.06 m/s (current speed)
- **Desired Headway:** 2 seconds (safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** -0.2 rad/s (slight right turn to follow the curve)
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** 3 (for smoother control)

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed of 7.06 m/s, maintaining its lane and being cautious of oncoming traffic. The road has a double solid line, indicating no overtaking. The vehicle should follow the curve of the road with a slight right turn.
