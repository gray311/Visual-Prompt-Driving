### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 15 (Car):** Initially detected in the right lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 21 (Car):** Detected in the left lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 18, 19, 16 (Cars):** Detected in the right lane, moving forward.
  - **ID 22 (Car):** Detected in the right lane, moving forward.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has slightly decreased from 7.06 m/s to 6.77 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle's acceleration has fluctuated, indicating minor adjustments in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been turning right, with the turn angle increasing from 3.6 degrees to -12.58 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The road has a double solid line, indicating no overtaking is allowed. The ego vehicle should stay in its lane and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.

### MPC Control Signals:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** 1
- **R (Control Effort):** 3 (Moderate control effort for smoother driving)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** 3 (Moderate headway maintenance for safe following distance)
- **Desired Speed:** 6.77 m/s (Maintain current speed)
- **Desired Headway:** 2 seconds (Safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** -0.5 rad/s (Slight right turn to follow the road curve)
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** 3 (Moderate weight for smoother control)

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed of 6.77 m/s, maintaining its lane and following the road's curve to the right. The vehicle should ensure a safe distance from the cars ahead and avoid overtaking due to the double solid line.
