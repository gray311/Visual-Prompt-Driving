### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Notable Objects**:
  - **Object 1**: Car, ID 12, located in the right lane, moving forward.
  - **Object 2**: Car, ID 13, located in the right lane, moving forward.
  - **Object 3**: Car, ID 14, located in the right lane, moving forward.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 4.1 m/s to 6.48 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Decreasing from 1.54 m/s² to 0.61 m/s², indicating a gradual reduction in acceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly fluctuating around 18 degrees, indicating a consistent right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle is on a right curve with a double solid line, indicating no overtaking.
- There are multiple cars ahead in the right lane, but they are not within immediate collision range.
- Maintain a constant speed and continue following the curve.

### MPC Control Signals:

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 1
- **R (Control Effort)**: 3 (moderate control effort for smooth driving)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (moderate emphasis on maintaining a safe distance)
- **Desired Speed**: 6.48 m/s (current speed)
- **Desired Headway**: 2 seconds (safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: -0.2 rad/s (slight right turn to follow the curve)
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (moderate emphasis on smooth turning)

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should maintain its current speed and follow the curve to the right, keeping a safe distance from the cars ahead. The control signals are set to ensure smooth and safe driving through the curve.
