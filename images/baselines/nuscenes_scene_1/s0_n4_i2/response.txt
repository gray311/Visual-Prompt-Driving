### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Traffic Light**: The traffic light is yellow in the first three frames and red in the last frame.
2. **Vehicles**: 
   - A black car is approaching from the left side of the intersection.
   - Multiple vehicles are present on the road ahead, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle.
3. **Pedestrians**: Several pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks, but none are crossing the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is transitioning from yellow to red. According to traffic rules, the vehicle should stop if it is safe to do so.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with a slight decrease and then an increase.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been positive but decreasing, indicating a slight deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle indicates a slight left turn over the last 4 seconds.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: STOP
- **Speed**: DECELERATION TO ZERO

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should decelerate to a stop at the intersection due to the red traffic light. Ensure a complete stop before the stop line and wait for the light to turn green.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 0,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle decelerates smoothly to the desired speed of 0.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for a smooth deceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0 to bring the vehicle to a complete stop.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds to ensure a safe stopping distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should stop in a straight line.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
