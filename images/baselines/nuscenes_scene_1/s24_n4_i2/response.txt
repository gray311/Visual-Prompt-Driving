### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects:**
  - **Vehicle 1:** Black SUV in the same lane, approximately 20 meters ahead.
  - **Vehicle 2:** White car parked on the right side of the road.
  - **Vehicle 3:** Silver car parked on the left side of the road.
  - **Pedestrian:** On the right sidewalk, not crossing the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the images.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Increasing from 3.85 m/s to 6.4 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** Slightly decreasing from 1.04 m/s² to 0.87 m/s².
- **Turn Angle:** Slightly increasing left turn angle from -11.05° to -12.11°.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed.
- Monitor the black SUV ahead and maintain a safe distance.
- Be aware of parked vehicles on both sides of the road and the pedestrian on the sidewalk.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 6.4,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 6.4 m/s to maintain current speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2 seconds for safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the road is straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smooth control.
