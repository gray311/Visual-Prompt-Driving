### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1 (Black SUV)**
   - Lane: Left lane, moving from left to right across the intersection.
   - Movement: Entering the intersection from the left side, potentially crossing the ego vehicle's path.

2. **Object ID 2 (Silver Sedan)**
   - Lane: Right lane, parked.
   - Movement: Stationary.

3. **Object ID 3 (White Sedan)**
   - Lane: Center lane, moving forward.
   - Movement: Moving forward in the same direction as the ego vehicle.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has decreased from 5.9 m/s to 1.78 m/s over the past 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been decelerating, with the acceleration decreasing from 2.79 m/s² to 0.12 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been maintaining a slight left turn angle, around -11 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while accelerating to maintain a safe distance from the black SUV crossing the intersection. The ego vehicle should be cautious and ready to decelerate if the black SUV does not clear the intersection in time.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 3.0 m/s to safely navigate the intersection.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 2 for smooth control.
