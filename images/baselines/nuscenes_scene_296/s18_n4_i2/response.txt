### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 1**: Small vehicle parked on the left side of the road.
  - **Lane**: Leftmost lane.
  - **Movement**: Stationary.
- **Object ID 2**: Vehicle in the distance, moving forward.
  - **Lane**: Center lane.
  - **Movement**: Moving forward.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 7.03 m/s to 7.94 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating an increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly increasing, indicating a slight turn to the right.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward along the road, maintaining a constant speed. There is a stationary vehicle on the left side of the road, which does not pose an immediate threat. The vehicle in the distance is moving forward in the center lane, and the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance.
