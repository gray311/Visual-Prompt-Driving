### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 1**: Small vehicle (possibly a maintenance vehicle) parked on the right side of the road.
  - Lane: Rightmost lane.
  - Movement: Stationary.
- **Object ID 2**: Another vehicle further ahead in the rightmost lane.
  - Lane: Rightmost lane.
  - Movement: Moving forward slowly.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has slightly decreased from 7.16 m/s to 7.03 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle's acceleration has varied, indicating minor adjustments in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has slightly decreased, indicating a minor leftward adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. There is a stationary vehicle parked on the right side of the road, but it does not obstruct the ego vehicle's lane. The ego vehicle should stay in its current lane and be aware of the moving vehicle further ahead.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 7.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a constant speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 7.0 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
