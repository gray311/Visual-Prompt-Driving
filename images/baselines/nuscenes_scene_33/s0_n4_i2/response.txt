### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects**: 
  - No vehicles or pedestrians detected within a 10-meter radius.
  - Road signs indicating "No Through Rd from 02 Jan '15" and "Carpark B" are visible but do not impact immediate driving behavior.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing from 8.33 m/s to 9.07 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle's acceleration has varied, with a peak at 1.16 m/s² and a decrease to 0.41 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been turning right, with the turn angle increasing from 0.0° to -18.14°.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward along the road while maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights to consider. The road curves to the right, so the vehicle should maintain its current trajectory.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 1,
  "desired_speed": 9.07,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": -0.2,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments, especially during the right turn.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 1 as there are no immediate vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 9.07 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds for a safe following distance, though no vehicles are currently ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to -0.2 rad/s to maintain the right turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control during the turn.
