### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Notable Objects**: 
  - No immediate vehicles or pedestrians within a 10-meter radius.
  - Road signs indicating directions and a car park.
  - Road markings indicating a right turn ahead.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing slightly over the last 4 seconds (from 9.07 m/s to 9.51 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Positive and consistent, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Decreasing from -18.14 degrees to -9.4 degrees, indicating a leftward turn that is straightening out.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward along the road.
- Maintain a constant speed as there are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights.
- Be aware of the road signs and markings indicating a right turn ahead.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 2,
  "desired_speed": 9.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 2 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 9.5 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the road ahead is straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
