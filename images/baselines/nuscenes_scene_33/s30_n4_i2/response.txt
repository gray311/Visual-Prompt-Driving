### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 1 (Truck)**: 
  - Lane: Left lane.
  - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly.
  - Impact: The truck is in the left lane and does not pose an immediate threat to the ego vehicle.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing slightly over the past 4 seconds, from 5.37 m/s to 4.99 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been experiencing varying acceleration, with a peak of 1.28 m/s² and a recent low of 0.26 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been adjusting its turn angle, indicating a slight left turn initially, followed by a slight right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining a constant speed. The truck in the left lane does not pose an immediate threat, and the road ahead is clear. The ego vehicle should stay in its lane and follow the road's curvature.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 2,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a constant speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 2 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.0 m/s to maintain a steady speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.1 to follow the road's slight curvature.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
