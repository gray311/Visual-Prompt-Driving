### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Pedestrian)**: 
  - Location: Crossing the road from the left to the right.
  - Lane: Crosswalk ahead.
  - Movement: Moving across the street.
- **Object 2 (Bus)**:
  - Location: Parked on the right side of the road.
  - Lane: Right lane.
  - Movement: Stationary.
- **Object 3 (Vehicles)**:
  - Location: Parked on both sides of the road.
  - Lane: Both left and right lanes.
  - Movement: Stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The speed has been relatively stable, with a slight increase from 8.04 m/s to 8.5 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Consistent acceleration around 0.64 m/sÂ².
- **Turn Angle**: Minor adjustments in turn angle, indicating slight steering corrections.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: STOP
- **Speed**: DECELERATION TO ZERO

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should stop to allow the pedestrian to safely cross the street. After the pedestrian has crossed, the vehicle can proceed forward.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 0,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle quickly decelerates to a stop.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for a smooth deceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe distance from the pedestrian.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0 to stop the vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds to ensure a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should stop in a straight line.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
