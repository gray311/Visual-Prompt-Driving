### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Bus (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: Blocking the right lane, requiring the ego vehicle to stay in the left lane.

2. **Utility Trucks (ID: 2 and 3)**:
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: Blocking the right lane, requiring the ego vehicle to stay in the left lane.

3. **Traffic Cones (ID: 4)**:
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: Indicating a work zone, requiring the ego vehicle to stay in the left lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly over the past 4 seconds, maintaining a speed around 8.29 m/s.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been maintaining a relatively straight path with minor adjustments.

### High-Level Plan:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED
- **Summary**: The ego vehicle should continue moving forward in the left lane, maintaining a constant speed to avoid the stationary bus, utility trucks, and traffic cones in the right lane.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.29,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the current speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 8.29 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from any potential moving vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control while maintaining the lane.
