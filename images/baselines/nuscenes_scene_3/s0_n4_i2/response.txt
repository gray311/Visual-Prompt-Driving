### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Vehicles**: Several parked vehicles are observed on both sides of the road. There are no moving vehicles within the 10-meter radius.
- **Lanes**: The ego vehicle is in the right lane of a two-lane road, with a double solid yellow line indicating no overtaking.
- **Pedestrians**: No pedestrians are visible within the 10-meter radius.
- **Traffic Lights**: No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are present in the current view.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing slightly over the past 4 seconds, from 7.58 m/s to 8.44 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been positive but decreasing, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been increasing slightly, suggesting a minor adjustment to the right.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward along the road, maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop. The vehicle will stay in its current lane, adhering to the double solid yellow line indicating no overtaking.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.44,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the current speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 8.44 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from any potential vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
