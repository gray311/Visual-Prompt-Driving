### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Construction Truck (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, partially on the sidewalk.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact on the ego vehicle's lane.

2. **Bus (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, partially on the sidewalk.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact on the ego vehicle's lane.

3. **Traffic Cones (ID: 3)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, extending slightly into the left lane.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: Slightly narrows the left lane, requiring careful navigation.

4. **Car (ID: 4)**:
   - Lane: Left lane, moving forward.
   - Movement: Moving forward.
   - Impact: Potential interaction if the ego vehicle changes lanes.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with minor fluctuations.
- **Acceleration**: Minor positive acceleration, indicating a steady increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight variations in turn angle, indicating minor adjustments in steering.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining a constant speed. The traffic cones slightly narrow the left lane, so careful navigation is required. There is no immediate need to change lanes or stop.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 8,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.5,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 8 to prioritize maintaining the current speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 8.5 m/s to maintain a constant speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds for safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
