### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects**: 
  - Construction cones and barriers ahead in the lane.
  - Vehicles parked on the left side of the road.
  - No pedestrians or other moving vehicles within the 10-meter radius.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively stable but slightly decreasing from 7.8 m/s to 7.09 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been positive, indicating an attempt to maintain or increase speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been increasing, indicating a gradual turn to the left.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The road ahead has construction cones and barriers, so the vehicle should stay in its lane and avoid any sudden movements. There are no immediate obstacles within the 10-meter radius that require stopping or lane changes.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 7.5,
  "desired_headway": 1.5,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (Moderate importance to maintain the desired speed)
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (Low value for smooth control)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (Moderate importance for maintaining a safe distance)
- **Desired Speed**: 7.5 m/s (Maintain current speed)
- **Desired Headway**: 1.5 seconds (Safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 rad/s (No turning required)
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (Moderate importance for smooth control)

The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed, maintaining a safe distance from any potential obstacles and staying in its lane.
