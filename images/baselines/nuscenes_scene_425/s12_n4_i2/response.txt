### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Construction Cones**: Present on the right side of the road, indicating a construction zone. These cones are within the 10-meter radius and require attention to avoid collision.
2. **Pedestrian Crossing Sign**: Indicates a pedestrian crossing ahead, necessitating caution and readiness to stop if pedestrians are present.
3. **Traffic Lights**: Visible in the distance, but their current state is not clear from the images. Need to be prepared to respond to the traffic light indications as we approach.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle has been decelerating over the past 4 seconds, with speeds decreasing from 5.54 m/s to 3.54 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The vehicle's acceleration has been positive but decreasing, indicating a controlled deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been relatively stable, indicating a slight leftward orientation.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **MOVE FORWARD**: Continue moving forward along the road as per the navigation command.
- **STEER SLIGHTLY LEFT**: Adjust steering slightly to the left to avoid the construction cones on the right side of the road.

#### Speed:
- **CONSTANT SPEED**: Maintain a constant speed to navigate through the construction zone safely.

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward while steering slightly to the left to avoid construction cones.
- Maintain a constant speed to ensure safe navigation through the construction zone.
- Be prepared to respond to any pedestrians at the crossing and the traffic lights ahead.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.54,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

This plan ensures that the vehicle navigates safely through the construction zone while maintaining a constant speed and slight leftward orientation to avoid obstacles.
