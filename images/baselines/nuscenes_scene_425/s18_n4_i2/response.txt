### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Pedestrian Sign**: A pedestrian crossing sign is visible on the left side of the road.
- **Construction Cones**: Multiple construction cones are present on the right side of the road, indicating ongoing construction.
- **Detour Sign**: A detour sign is visible on the right side of the road.
- **Vehicles**: There are vehicles visible in the distance, but they are not within the immediate 10-meter radius.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the immediate vicinity.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing over the last 4 seconds, from 3.54 m/s to 5.11 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has varied, with a peak of 1.39 m/s² and a recent value of 0.36 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been increasing, indicating a slight left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. Be cautious of the construction cones and detour signs on the right side of the road. There are no immediate obstacles within the 10-meter radius that require stopping or lane changes. The pedestrian sign indicates the potential presence of pedestrians, so remain vigilant.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.11,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

- **Q**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R**: Set to 0.1 for smoother control.
- **Q_h**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: 5.11 m/s, matching the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: 2 seconds, ensuring a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0, indicating no turn is needed.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 2 for smoother control.
