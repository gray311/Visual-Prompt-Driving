### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects:**
  - Construction cones and barriers ahead in the lane.
  - Vehicles parked on the left side of the road.
  - Construction signs indicating roadwork ahead.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the immediate vicinity.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing over the last 4 seconds, from 7.09 m/s to 5.54 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The acceleration has been relatively constant, around 0.93 m/sÂ².
- **Turn Angle:** The turn angle has been increasing, indicating the vehicle is likely navigating a curve or preparing to avoid obstacles.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD while avoiding construction cones and barriers.
- **Speed Adjustment:** DECELERATION to navigate through the construction zone safely.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining a safe speed and being cautious of the construction zone ahead. The vehicle should decelerate to ensure it can navigate around the construction cones and barriers safely.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain a desired speed of 3.0 m/s through the construction zone.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smoother control while navigating around obstacles.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 3.0 m/s to ensure safe navigation through the construction zone.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from any potential obstacles or vehicles.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0.1 to make slight adjustments in steering to avoid obstacles.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smoother control during slight steering adjustments.
