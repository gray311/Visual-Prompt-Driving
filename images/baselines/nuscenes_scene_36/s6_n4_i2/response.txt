### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Truck (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, stationary.
   - Movement: No movement detected.
   - Impact: Potential obstacle if ego vehicle needs to change lanes.

2. **Car (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, moving forward.
   - Movement: Moving at a similar speed to the ego vehicle.
   - Impact: No immediate impact, but needs to be monitored for any sudden changes in speed or direction.

3. **Pedestrian (ID: 3)**:
   - Lane: Sidewalk, stationary.
   - Movement: No movement detected.
   - Impact: No immediate impact, but should be monitored.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 6.42 m/s to 8.14 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating increasing speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing from 20.3° to 26.03°, indicating a slight right turn.

### High-Level Plan:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED
- **Summary**: Continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. Monitor the car ahead and be prepared to decelerate if it slows down. No lane change is necessary at this moment.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 8.14,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed of 8.14 m/s. The car ahead should be monitored for any changes in speed or direction. No lane change is necessary at this moment, and the ego vehicle should maintain a safe headway distance.
