### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Vehicle (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a steady speed.
   - Impact: The vehicle is ahead in the same lane, so maintaining a safe following distance is crucial.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing from 8.93 m/s to 7.97 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Increasing from 0.65 m/s² to 2.61 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: Decreasing from 28.96° to -6.99°, indicating a right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. The road curves to the right, so slight steering adjustments may be necessary to stay within the lane.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,

  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a constant speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 8.0 m/s to maintain a steady speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to -0.1 rad/s for slight right steering.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
