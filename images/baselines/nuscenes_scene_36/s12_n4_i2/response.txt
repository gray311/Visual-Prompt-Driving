### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID: 1 (Black Car)**
   - Lane: Center lane.
   - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a steady speed.
   
2. **Object ID: 2 (Truck)**
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Stationary, parked on the side of the road.

3. **Object ID: 3 (Construction Workers)**
   - Lane: Left side of the road.
   - Movement: Stationary, engaged in construction work.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing slightly over the past 4 seconds, from 8.14 m/s to 9.43 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The acceleration has been decreasing, indicating a gradual approach to a constant speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The turn angle has remained relatively constant, indicating the vehicle is maintaining a straight path.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. There is a stationary truck on the right side of the road and construction workers on the left side, but they do not pose an immediate threat. The black car ahead is moving forward in the same lane, so maintaining a safe following distance is crucial.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 9.43,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should maintain its current speed and continue moving forward, keeping a safe distance from the black car ahead. The stationary truck and construction workers do not require any immediate action but should be monitored.
