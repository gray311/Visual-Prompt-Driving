### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Position: 8 meters ahead, same lane
   - Movement: Moving at a similar speed to ego

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Position: 6 meters to the right, on the sidewalk
   - Movement: Stationary

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Position: 10 meters ahead
   - Status: Green

4. **Object ID 4**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Position: 5 meters behind, same lane
   - Movement: Approaching ego at a higher speed

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light ahead is green, so we can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 4.55 m/s to 5.99 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Varying, with a peak of 1.09 m/s² and a low of 0.48 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: Negative values indicate a slight leftward drift, with a peak turn angle of -11.44 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed.
- Monitor the vehicle ahead (Object ID 1) and maintain a safe distance.
- Be aware of the vehicle approaching from behind (Object ID 4).
- Ensure no sudden lane changes or stops are necessary as the traffic light is green.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 6.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: 6.0 m/s, slightly above the current speed to maintain momentum.
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0, as we are moving forward without turning.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 for balanced control.
