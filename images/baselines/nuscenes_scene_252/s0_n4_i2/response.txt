### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving forward at a similar speed

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing the road ahead
   - Distance: 6 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving from left to right

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead
   - Distance: 10 meters ahead
   - State: Red

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light ahead is red, requiring a stop.

#### Ego Analysis:
- Over the last 4 seconds, the ego vehicle has been decelerating gradually from 8.2 m/s to 5.84 m/s.
- The turn angle indicates a slight rightward adjustment, likely to maintain lane position.
- Given the red traffic light and the pedestrian crossing, the ego vehicle must prepare to stop.

### High-Level Plan:
- **Behavior**: STOP
- **Speed**: DECELERATION TO ZERO
- **Summary**: The ego vehicle will decelerate to a stop due to the red traffic light and the pedestrian crossing ahead. It will maintain lane position and ensure a safe stop distance from the pedestrian and the stop line.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 4,
  "desired_speed": 0,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize achieving the desired speed quickly, which is zero in this case.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for a smooth deceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 4 to ensure a safe following distance, especially important when stopping.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0 m/s to stop the vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the pedestrian and the stop line.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 rad/s as the vehicle is stopping in a straight line.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control during the deceleration process.
