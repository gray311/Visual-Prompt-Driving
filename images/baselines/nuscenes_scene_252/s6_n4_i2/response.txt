### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID: 1**
   - **Type:** Vehicle
   - **Lane:** Same lane as ego
   - **Distance:** 8 meters ahead
   - **Movement:** Moving forward at a similar speed to ego

2. **Object ID: 2**
   - **Type:** Pedestrian
   - **Lane:** Crossing from the right side, 6 meters ahead
   - **Movement:** Moving left to right across the road

3. **Object ID: 3**
   - **Type:** Traffic Light
   - **Lane:** Overhead
   - **Distance:** 10 meters ahead
   - **State:** Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, indicating that the ego vehicle can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has varied slightly, with a slight deceleration followed by acceleration.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been making slight adjustments to the left, with a more significant left turn in the last second.
- **Behavior:** The ego vehicle has been maintaining a forward trajectory with minor leftward adjustments.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward while decelerating to avoid collision with the pedestrian crossing the road. The traffic light is green, so there is no need to stop for the light. The vehicle ahead is at a safe distance, and no lane change is required.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle maintains the desired speed quickly after deceleration.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for a balance between smooth control and responsiveness.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 3.0 m/s to decelerate and avoid the pedestrian.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0.0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 2 for smoother control while maintaining the lane.
