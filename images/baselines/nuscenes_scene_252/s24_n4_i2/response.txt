### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving at a similar speed to ego

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing from left to right
   - Distance: 6 meters ahead
   - Movement: Walking across the road

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead
   - Status: Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, so we are clear to proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- Over the last 4 seconds, the ego vehicle has been decelerating (speed decreased from 4.94 m/s to 3.12 m/s).
- The turn angle has increased, indicating a slight left turn.
- The acceleration has been positive, indicating attempts to maintain or increase speed despite deceleration.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION (due to pedestrian crossing)

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward while decelerating to avoid collision with the pedestrian crossing the road.
- Maintain awareness of the vehicle ahead and ensure a safe following distance.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 4,
  "desired_speed": 2.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure a quick adjustment to the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smoother control during deceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 4 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 2.0 m/s to safely decelerate for the pedestrian.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.1 rad/s to continue the slight left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control during the turn.
