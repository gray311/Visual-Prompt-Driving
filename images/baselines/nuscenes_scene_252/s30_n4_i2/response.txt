### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object 1 (ID: 101)**
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same lane as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving forward at a similar speed

2. **Object 2 (ID: 102)**
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing from left to right
   - Distance: 6 meters ahead
   - Movement: Walking slowly

3. **Object 3 (ID: 103)**
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead
   - State: Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, so we can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 3.12 m/s to 5.79 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Generally positive, indicating a steady increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Decreasing from 13.42 degrees to -1.46 degrees, indicating a slight rightward adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION
- **Summary**: Move forward while decelerating to avoid collision with the pedestrian crossing ahead. Maintain awareness of the vehicle in the same lane.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure a quick adjustment to the desired speed of 3.0 m/s.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for a balance between smooth control and responsiveness.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 3.0 m/s to decelerate and avoid the pedestrian.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as we are moving forward without turning.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 2 for moderate smoothness in control.
