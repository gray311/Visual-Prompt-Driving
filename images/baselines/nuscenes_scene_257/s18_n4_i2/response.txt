### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same lane as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Constant speed, no lane change

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing the road from left to right, 5 meters ahead
   - Movement: Walking at a moderate pace

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead, 10 meters ahead
   - State: Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, indicating that we can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 2.88 m/s to 4.16 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Generally positive, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Initially a slight left turn, followed by a right turn, and then a sharper right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION (due to pedestrian crossing)
- **Summary**: 
  - Continue moving forward while decelerating to avoid collision with the pedestrian.
  - Maintain awareness of the vehicle ahead and adjust speed accordingly.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure a quick adjustment to the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for a balance between smooth control and responsiveness.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Reduced to 2.0 m/s to safely navigate around the pedestrian.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as we are moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control while maintaining responsiveness.
