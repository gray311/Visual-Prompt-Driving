### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1 (Vehicle)**:
   - Lane: Adjacent lane to the left.
   - Movement: Moving parallel to ego, slightly ahead.
   - Impact: Potential lane change conflict if ego decides to change lanes.

2. **Object ID 2 (Pedestrian)**:
   - Lane: Crosswalk ahead.
   - Movement: Stationary, waiting to cross.
   - Impact: No immediate impact unless pedestrian starts crossing.

3. **Object ID 3 (Traffic Light)**:
   - Lane: Directly ahead.
   - Status: Green.
   - Impact: Ego can proceed without stopping.

4. **Object ID 4 (Vehicle)**:
   - Lane: Same lane as ego, 8 meters ahead.
   - Movement: Moving forward at a constant speed.
   - Impact: Maintain safe following distance.

#### Traffic Light:
- Status: Green.
- Action: Proceed forward.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing trend over the last 4 seconds (2.28 m/s to 0.44 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Fluctuating but generally positive, indicating attempts to maintain or increase speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly negative, indicating a slight leftward drift.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: ACCELERATION to match desired speed.

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward as per the navigation command.
- Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- Be cautious of the pedestrian at the crosswalk.
- No lane changes required at this moment.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize reaching and maintaining the desired speed of 2.5 m/s.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for a balance between smooth control and responsiveness.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: 2.5 m/s, slightly higher than current speed to match traffic flow.
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0, indicating no turn is required.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
