### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same lane as ego
   - Distance: 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving forward at a similar speed

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing the road from the right side, 6 meters ahead
   - Movement: Moving left to right across the road

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Overhead, 10 meters ahead
   - State: Green

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, indicating that the ego vehicle can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been slightly decreasing over the last 4 seconds, from 4.63 m/s to 4.28 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been fluctuating, indicating minor adjustments in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been increasing negatively, indicating a left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION (due to pedestrian crossing)
- **Summary**: The ego vehicle should continue moving forward but decelerate to allow the pedestrian to cross safely. The vehicle ahead is maintaining a similar speed, so no immediate lane change is necessary.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle maintains a desired speed after deceleration.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 2.0 m/s to decelerate for the pedestrian crossing.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving forward.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control.
