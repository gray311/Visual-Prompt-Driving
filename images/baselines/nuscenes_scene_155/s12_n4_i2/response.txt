### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1**: Green container on the right side of the lane.
  - **Lane**: Right lane.
  - **Movement**: Stationary.
  - **Impact**: Potential obstacle if the ego vehicle drifts to the right.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (6.86 m/s to 5.43 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Positive but decreasing trend (0.45 m/s² to 0.54 m/s²).
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly increasing and then stabilizing (8.62° to 9.9°).

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed**: DECELERATION.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to maintain control and avoid the stationary green container on the right side of the lane. The vehicle should stay centered in its lane to avoid drifting towards the obstacle.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle maintains a steady speed while decelerating.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.0 m/s to continue moving forward safely.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from any potential moving objects.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
