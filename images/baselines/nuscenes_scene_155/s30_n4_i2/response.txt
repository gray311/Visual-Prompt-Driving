### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects**:
  - Vehicles parked on the left side of the road.
  - A kiosk and a tent on the left side of the road.
  - No moving vehicles or pedestrians within a 10-meter radius.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing over the last 4 seconds, from 4.11 m/s to 5.08 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been positive, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been decreasing, suggesting the vehicle is straightening out from a turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward along the road, maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights that require stopping or slowing down. The vehicle should be aware of the parked cars on the left side and ensure it stays within its lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.08,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (to maintain the desired speed effectively)
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (for smooth control)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (to maintain a safe following distance)
- **Desired Speed**: 5.08 m/s (current speed)
- **Desired Headway**: 2 seconds (safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 rad/s (straight path)
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (for smooth control)
