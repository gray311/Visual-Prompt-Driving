### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects**: 
  - Vehicles parked on both sides of the road.
  - Pedestrian crossing ahead.
  - No moving vehicles or pedestrians detected within a 10-meter radius.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 4.08 m/s to 6.89 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Positive but decreasing, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight variations, indicating minor adjustments in direction.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD

#### Speed:
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- Continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed.
- Be aware of parked vehicles on both sides and the pedestrian crossing ahead.
- No immediate need to stop or change lanes.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 2,
  "desired_speed": 6.89,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the current speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 2 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 6.89 m/s to match the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds for safety.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as no turning is required.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
