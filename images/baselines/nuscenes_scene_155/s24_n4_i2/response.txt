### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Object**: Large green dumpster (ID: 1)
  - **Lane**: Partially in the ego lane, partially in the adjacent lane.
  - **Movement**: Stationary.
- **Other Objects**: Parked cars on the right side of the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has varied slightly, with a recent increase to 4.11 m/s.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been turning slightly to the left, with the angle increasing from 9.44 to 25.62 degrees.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been relatively stable, with a slight decrease.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: CHANGE LANE TO LEFT
- **Speed Adjustment**: DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle needs to change lanes to the left to avoid the stationary dumpster obstructing the current lane. Deceleration is required to safely execute the lane change.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a desired speed during the lane change.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for a smooth control response during the lane change.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 3.0 m/s to decelerate slightly for a safe lane change.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from any potential vehicles ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.1 rad/s for a slight left lane change.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control during the lane change.
