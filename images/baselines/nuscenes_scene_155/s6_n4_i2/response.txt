### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object ID 1**: Green container in the middle of the lane, approximately 10 meters ahead.
- **Object ID 2**: Parked cars on the right side of the road.
- **Object ID 3**: Traffic cones on the sidewalk.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, averaging around 6.88 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been decreasing slightly, indicating a slight deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been increasing, suggesting the vehicle is gradually turning left.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED
- **Summary**: The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The green container in the lane ahead should be monitored, and the vehicle should be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 6.88,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed of approximately 6.88 m/s. The green container ahead should be monitored, and the vehicle should be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The turn angle indicates a slight left turn, so the desired yaw rate is set to 0.1 rad/s to maintain a smooth trajectory.
