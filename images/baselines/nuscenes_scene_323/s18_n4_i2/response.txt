### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object 1 (Black Car)**:
   - Lane: Parked on the left side of the road.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact on ego vehicle's path.

2. **Object 2 (Silver Car)**:
   - Lane: Moving towards the ego vehicle from the opposite direction.
   - Movement: Approaching.
   - Impact: Potential impact if it moves into the ego vehicle's lane.

3. **Object 3 (Truck)**:
   - Lane: Parked on the right side of the road.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact on ego vehicle's path.

4. **Object 4 (Pedestrian/Worker)**:
   - Lane: On the right side of the road, near the truck.
   - Movement: Stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact on ego vehicle's path.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 1.91 m/s to 4.25 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating an increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Negative values indicate a left turn, but the angle is decreasing, suggesting a return to a straight path.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The silver car approaching from the opposite direction should be monitored closely to ensure it does not enter the ego vehicle's lane. The parked vehicles and pedestrian/worker do not pose an immediate threat.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.25,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smoother control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.25 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds to ensure a safe distance from any potential obstacles.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control.
