### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects:**
  - **Trash Bins:** Located on the left sidewalk, not in the driving lane.
  - **Speed Hump:** Marked on the road, indicating a need to slow down.
  - **Vehicles:** No vehicles within the immediate 10-meter radius in the driving lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing slightly over the last 4 seconds, from 5.84 m/s to 6.51 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The acceleration has been relatively low, indicating a smooth increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The turn angle has been minor, indicating the vehicle is mostly moving straight with slight adjustments.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** DECELERATION (due to the upcoming speed hump)

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating to safely navigate over the speed hump. There are no immediate obstacles in the driving lane, and the road ahead is clear.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle maintains a desired speed after decelerating for the speed hump.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance, though no immediate vehicles are present.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 4.0 m/s to slow down for the speed hump.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance if any vehicles appear.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for balanced control.
