### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects:**
  - **Vehicle (ID: 1)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **Pedestrian (ID: 2)**: Walking on the sidewalk on the left side.
  - **Vehicle (ID: 3)**: Parked on the right side of the road, further ahead.
  - **Vehicle (ID: 4)**: Parked on the left side of the road, further ahead.
  - **Pedestrian (ID: 5)**: Walking on the sidewalk on the right side.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle is decelerating over the last 4 seconds (from 5.33 m/s to 1.47 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been experiencing positive acceleration, indicating a slow deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle is slightly turning to the right (from 0.27° to 0.5°).

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while accelerating to reach a desired speed. There are no immediate obstacles in the lane, but the vehicle should be cautious of parked vehicles and pedestrians on both sides of the road.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a consistent speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 to ensure smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.0 m/s to match the initial speed before deceleration.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from any potential moving vehicles.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 to ensure smooth directional control.
