### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Adjacent lane to the left
   - Movement: Moving parallel to ego, slightly ahead

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crosswalk ahead, moving from left to right

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Directly ahead
   - State: Green

4. **Object ID 4**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Same lane as ego, 8 meters ahead
   - Movement: Slowing down

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light ahead is green, indicating that the ego vehicle can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing slightly over the past 4 seconds, from 4.17 m/s to 4.64 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been relatively stable, with a slight decrease in the last second.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle indicates that the ego vehicle is making a slight left turn, but the angle is decreasing, suggesting a return to a straighter path.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: DECELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will continue moving forward as per the navigation command.
- Deceleration is necessary due to the vehicle ahead slowing down.
- Maintain awareness of the pedestrian on the crosswalk and the adjacent vehicle.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 3.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining a safe and consistent speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smoother control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Reduced to 3.5 m/s to match the slowing vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the ego vehicle is moving forward.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 2 for balanced control during slight adjustments.
