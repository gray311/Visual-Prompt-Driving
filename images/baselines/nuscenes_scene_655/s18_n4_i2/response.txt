### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Adjacent left lane
   - Movement: Moving parallel to ego, slightly ahead, maintaining a constant speed.
2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crossing the road from the right, approximately 8 meters ahead.
3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - State: Green
   - Location: 15 meters ahead, center of the lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light is green, indicating that the ego vehicle can proceed.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with a slight increase and then a minor decrease, indicating stable driving.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been decreasing, suggesting the vehicle is stabilizing its speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been increasing negatively, indicating a leftward turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining a constant speed. The pedestrian crossing the road ahead should be monitored closely, and the vehicle should be prepared to decelerate if necessary to avoid a collision. The green traffic light allows for continued movement without stopping.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.2,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle maintains the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.2 m/s, which is the current speed, to maintain stability.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control during straight movement.
