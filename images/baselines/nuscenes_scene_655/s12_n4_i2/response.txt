### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: 
   - Type: Vehicle
   - Lane: Adjacent lane to the right
   - Movement: Moving parallel to ego, slightly ahead
   - Impact: Potential lane change hazard if ego moves right

2. **Object ID 2**: 
   - Type: Pedestrian
   - Lane: Crosswalk ahead
   - Movement: Stationary, waiting to cross
   - Impact: No immediate impact unless pedestrian starts crossing

3. **Object ID 3**: 
   - Type: Traffic Light
   - Lane: Directly ahead
   - State: Green
   - Impact: Proceed forward as per traffic rules

#### Traffic Light:
- The traffic light ahead is green, allowing ego to proceed forward.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing trend from 3.64 m/s to 4.0 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Generally positive, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Significant left turn over the last 4 seconds, from -6.16 degrees to -74.11 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, maintaining a constant speed. There is no need for lane changes or stops as the traffic light is green and the pedestrian is stationary. The vehicle in the adjacent lane poses no immediate threat but should be monitored.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.2 for smooth control, considering the recent turn.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: 4.0 m/s, matching the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from any vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0, as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
