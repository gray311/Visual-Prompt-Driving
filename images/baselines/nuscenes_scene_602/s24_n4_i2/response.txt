### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1 (Vehicle)**:
   - Lane: Adjacent lane to the left.
   - Movement: Moving parallel to ego, slightly ahead.
   - Impact: Potential lane change risk if ego moves left.

2. **Object ID 2 (Pedestrian)**:
   - Lane: Crossing the road ahead, about 8 meters away.
   - Movement: Walking from left to right.
   - Impact: High risk of collision if ego continues without stopping.

3. **Object ID 3 (Traffic Light)**:
   - Lane: Directly ahead.
   - State: Red.
   - Impact: Ego must stop.

#### Traffic Light:
- **Red Light**: Ego must stop to comply with traffic rules.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 0.14 m/s to 3.96 m/s over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: Consistent increase, indicating acceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing turn angle, suggesting a leftward turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **STOP**: Due to the red traffic light and pedestrian crossing.

#### Speed:
- **DECELERATION TO ZERO**: To comply with the red light and avoid collision with the pedestrian.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will decelerate to a stop due to the red traffic light and pedestrian crossing. It will remain stopped until the light turns green and the pedestrian has safely crossed.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 5,
  "desired_speed": 0,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle decelerates to the desired speed (0 m/s) quickly.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 to allow for smooth deceleration.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain a safe distance from the pedestrian.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0 m/s to stop the vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds to ensure a safe stopping distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is stopping and not turning.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control during deceleration.
