### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Truck on the left)**: Parked on the left side of the road.
- **Object 2 (Truck on the right)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
- **Object 3 (Pedestrians)**: Several pedestrians are walking and standing near the trucks on the left.
- **Object 4 (White car ahead)**: Moving forward in the same lane as the ego vehicle.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the images.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing slightly over the past 4 seconds, from 4.21 m/s to 5.29 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration has been positive but decreasing, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: The turn angle has been relatively stable, indicating the vehicle is maintaining a steady direction.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. It should be cautious of the pedestrians and parked trucks on both sides of the road. The white car ahead should be monitored for any sudden stops or changes in speed.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.29,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the current speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.29 m/s, the current speed of the ego vehicle.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
