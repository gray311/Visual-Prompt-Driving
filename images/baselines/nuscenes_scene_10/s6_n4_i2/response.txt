### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Truck (ID: 1)**: 
   - Lane: Left lane, stationary.
   - Impact: Blocking the left lane, requiring the ego vehicle to stay in the right lane.

2. **Car (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, moving forward.
   - Impact: Moving ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance.

3. **Truck (ID: 3)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, stationary.
   - Impact: Parked on the right side of the road, no immediate impact on the ego vehicle's path.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 2.28 m/s to 4.21 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating the vehicle is speeding up.
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing from 21.97° to 37.26°, indicating a slight right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **MOVE FORWARD**: Continue moving forward in the right lane.

#### Speed:
- **CONSTANT SPEED**: Maintain a constant speed to keep a safe distance from the car ahead.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward in the right lane, maintaining a constant speed to ensure a safe distance from the car ahead. No lane changes or stops are required.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.21,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 4.21 m/s to match the current speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2 seconds for a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
