### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Truck on the left)**: Stationary, occupying the left lane.
- **Object 2 (White car ahead)**: Moving slowly, occupying the left lane.
- **Object 3 (Construction equipment)**: Stationary, occupying the left lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has been decreasing slightly over the last 4 seconds (from 5.08 m/s to 4.63 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: The acceleration values indicate minor deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle is turning slightly to the right (decreasing turn angle from 41.23° to 37.8°).

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed**: DECELERATION
- **Summary**: The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to maintain a safe distance from the white car ahead. Given the stationary truck and construction equipment on the left, the ego vehicle should stay in the right lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": -0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating slightly to maintain a safe distance from the white car ahead. Given the stationary truck and construction equipment on the left, the ego vehicle should stay in the right lane. The MPC signals are set to ensure smooth deceleration and lane maintenance.
