### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **Object ID 1**: Black vehicle (likely a delivery truck) in the right lane ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Stationary or moving slowly.
2. **Object ID 2**: Black SUV further ahead in the right lane.
   - Lane: Right lane.
   - Movement: Moving forward slowly.
3. **Object ID 3**: Parked vehicles on both sides of the road.
   - Lane: Both sides.
   - Movement: Stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (from 4.76 m/s to 3.2 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Positive but decreasing, indicating the vehicle is slowing down.
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly negative, indicating a slight right turn or lane adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: DECELERATION.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while decelerating to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead (Object ID 1). The road ahead is clear of immediate obstacles, but the ego vehicle should be cautious of the parked vehicles on both sides and the moving vehicles in the right lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to ensure the vehicle maintains a steady speed while decelerating.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 2.5 m/s to continue moving forward cautiously.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
