### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
1. **UPS Truck (ID: 1)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, stationary.
   - Impact: Blocking the right lane, requiring the ego vehicle to stay in the left lane.

2. **XPO Truck (ID: 2)**:
   - Lane: Left lane, moving forward.
   - Impact: Moving vehicle ahead in the same lane, requiring safe following distance.

3. **Parked Vehicles (ID: 3, 4, 5, etc.)**:
   - Lane: Right lane, stationary.
   - Impact: No immediate impact as they are parked.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle's speed has varied, with a slight increase in the last second.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating, with the highest acceleration in the last second.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has been making slight turns, with the most significant turn angle in the last second.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **MOVE FORWARD**: Continue moving forward in the left lane.

#### Speed:
- **CONSTANT SPEED**: Maintain a constant speed to ensure safe following distance from the XPO truck ahead.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward in the left lane, maintaining a constant speed to ensure a safe distance from the XPO truck ahead. The right lane is blocked by a stationary UPS truck and parked vehicles, so lane changes are not advisable.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 1.8,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 1.8 m/s, based on the last recorded speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smooth control.
