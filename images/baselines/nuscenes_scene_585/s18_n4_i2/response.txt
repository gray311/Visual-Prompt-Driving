### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects:**
  - **Vehicle 1 (UPS truck):** Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **Vehicle 2 (Black SUV):** Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **Vehicle 3 (XPO truck):** Moving ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
  - **Other vehicles:** Parked along both sides of the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing over the past 4 seconds, from 1.8 m/s to 4.53 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The acceleration has been decreasing, indicating the vehicle is approaching a constant speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The turn angle has been decreasing, indicating the vehicle is straightening out after a slight turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward at a constant speed. It should be aware of the parked vehicles on both sides and maintain a safe distance from the moving XPO truck ahead. No lane changes or stops are necessary at this moment.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 4.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.2 for smoother control.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 4.5 m/s to match the current speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle should continue straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smoother control.
