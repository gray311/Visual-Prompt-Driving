### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (ID: Truck)**: 
  - Lane: Center
  - Movement: Stationary
  - Distance: Approximately 10 meters ahead
- **Object 2 (ID: Car 1)**:
  - Lane: Center
  - Movement: Moving forward
  - Distance: Approximately 12 meters ahead
- **Object 3 (ID: Parked Cars)**:
  - Lane: Both sides
  - Movement: Stationary
  - Distance: Varies, but not within immediate path

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (from 4.53 m/s to 2.21 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Increasing (from 0.35 m/s² to 1.27 m/s²).
- **Turn Angle**: Slight left turn initially, followed by a slight right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: ACCELERATION (to maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead)

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a safe distance from the truck ahead. Given the stationary truck and the moving car, the ego vehicle should accelerate slightly to maintain a safe following distance and avoid stopping unnecessarily.

### MPC Signals:

  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.2,
  "Q_h": 3,

}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (to achieve desired speed quickly)
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.2 (for smoother control)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 3 (to maintain a safe following distance)
- **Desired Speed**: 3.0 m/s (to maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead)
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds (to ensure a safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 (no turning required)
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 2 (for smoother control)
