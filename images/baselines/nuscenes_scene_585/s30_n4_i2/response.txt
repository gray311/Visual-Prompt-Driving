### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Notable Objects**:
  - **Vehicle 1**: Black SUV ahead in the same lane, moving slowly.
  - **Vehicle 2**: White truck (XPO) ahead in the same lane, stationary or moving very slowly.
  - **Parked Vehicles**: On both sides of the road, not affecting the current lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the images.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds (2.21 m/s to 0.12 m/s).
- **Acceleration**: Decreasing, indicating a gradual deceleration.
- **Turn Angle**: Slight left turn (-3.24 to -3.2 degrees).

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: ACCELERATION
- **Summary**: Continue moving forward while maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. The road is clear of immediate obstacles, and the ego vehicle should accelerate to a safe speed while monitoring the black SUV and the white truck ahead.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 2.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Summary:
The ego vehicle should continue moving forward, accelerating to a safe speed while maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. The road is clear of immediate obstacles, and the ego vehicle should monitor the black SUV and the white truck ahead. The MPC control signals are set to prioritize maintaining a safe speed and headway while ensuring smooth control.
