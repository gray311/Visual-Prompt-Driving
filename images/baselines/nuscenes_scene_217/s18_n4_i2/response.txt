### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Orange Car)**: 
  - Lane: Same lane as ego vehicle.
  - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a constant speed.
  - Distance: Approximately 10 meters ahead of the ego vehicle.
- **Object 2 (Motorcycle)**:
  - Lane: Adjacent lane to the right.
  - Movement: Moving forward, maintaining a constant speed.
  - Distance: Approximately 15 meters ahead of the ego vehicle.
- **Object 3 (Red Car)**:
  - Lane: Adjacent lane to the left.
  - Movement: Stationary.
  - Distance: Approximately 15 meters ahead of the ego vehicle.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Decreasing over the last 4 seconds from 4.7 m/s to 2.42 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Increasing slightly from 0.89 m/s² to 1.27 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly decreasing from 6.16 degrees to -0.1 degrees, indicating a slight right turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment**: ACCELERATION

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while accelerating to maintain a safe distance from the orange car ahead. There is no need for lane changes or stops as the road ahead is clear, and the navigation command is to keep forward along the road.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.0,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to prioritize maintaining the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.0 m/s to match the road conditions and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0 as the ego vehicle should continue moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for balanced control.
