### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Bus)**: 
  - Lane: Right lane.
  - Movement: Stationary, parked on the side of the road.
  - Distance: Approximately 30 meters ahead.

- **Object 2 (Pedestrians)**:
  - Lane: Right sidewalk.
  - Movement: Walking away from the road.
  - Distance: Approximately 35 meters ahead.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 6.89 m/s to 8.6 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Decreasing from 1.17 m/s² to 0.8 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: Slightly fluctuating around 9 degrees, indicating a slight turn or lane adjustment.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed Adjustment**: CONSTANT SPEED.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward along the road, maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles within a 10-meter radius that require stopping or significant speed adjustments. The bus and pedestrians are far enough ahead not to impact the current driving plan.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 2,
  "desired_speed": 8.6,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: 5 (Moderate importance to maintain the current speed).
- **R (Control Effort)**: 0.1 (Low control effort for smooth driving).
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: 2 (Moderate importance for maintaining a safe following distance).
- **Desired Speed**: 8.6 m/s (Current speed).
- **Desired Headway**: 2 seconds (Safe following distance).
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 0 rad/s (No turn required).
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: 3 (Moderate weight for smooth control).
