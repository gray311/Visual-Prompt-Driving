### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (White Car)**:
  - **Lane**: Parked on the left side of the road.
  - **Movement**: Stationary.
  - **Impact**: No immediate impact on ego vehicle's path as it is parked off the main lane.

- **Object 2 (Bus)**:
  - **Lane**: In the middle of the road ahead.
  - **Movement**: Moving forward slowly.
  - **Impact**: Potential obstacle if it slows down or stops.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Increasing from 4.63 m/s to 5.41 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Positive, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing from 0.0 to 13.89 degrees, indicating a slight left turn over the last 4 seconds.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: MOVE FORWARD.
- **Speed**: CONSTANT SPEED.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The parked white car on the left does not pose a threat, but the bus ahead should be monitored for any sudden stops or changes in speed. The ego vehicle should be prepared to decelerate if the bus slows down significantly.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.5,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance from the bus ahead.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 5.5 m/s to maintain a constant speed.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to keep a safe distance from the bus.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 0.0 as the vehicle should move straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 2 for smooth control.
