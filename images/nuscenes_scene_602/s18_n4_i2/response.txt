### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs**: 6, 7, 8, 9
- **Type**: Cars
- **Location**: All objects are located on the sidewalk adjacent to the brick building.
- **Movement**: The cars are stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle has been moving at very low speeds, with a slight increase and then decrease over the last 4 seconds.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly, with the highest acceleration recorded at 1.29 m/sÂ².
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle's turn angle has been increasing, indicating a leftward turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action**: Execute a left 3-point turn.
- **Speed Adjustment**: Deceleration to zero to initiate the turn, followed by slight acceleration to complete the maneuver.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will decelerate to a stop, turn left, then reverse slightly, and finally turn left again to complete the 3-point turn.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 3,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 4,
  "desired_speed": 2,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 3.0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Set to 1 to maintain a low speed during the maneuver.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 3 for moderate control effort, ensuring smooth execution of the turn.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 4 to maintain a safe distance from any potential obstacles.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0.5 m/s to allow for a controlled and safe turn.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 2.0 seconds to ensure enough space for maneuvering.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 3.0 rad/s to execute the left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 4 to ensure smooth turning without abrupt changes.
