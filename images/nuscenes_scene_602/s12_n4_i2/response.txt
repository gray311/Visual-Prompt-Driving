### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects Identified:**
  - Object ID 6: Car (cor)
  - Object ID 7: Car (cor)
- **Lanes and Movements:**
  - Both objects are stationary and located on the sidewalk to the right of the ego vehicle's current position.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:**
  - The ego vehicle's speed has decreased significantly over the last 4 seconds, from 2.22 m/s to 0.03 m/s.
- **Acceleration:**
  - The ego vehicle experienced varying acceleration, with a significant decrease in the last second.
- **Turn Angle:**
  - The ego vehicle's turn angle increased from 44.96 degrees to 111.79 degrees, indicating a leftward turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** Execute a left 3-point turn.
- **Speed Adjustment:** Deceleration to zero, then controlled acceleration and deceleration during the turn.

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will perform a left 3-point turn to comply with the navigation command. This involves stopping, turning left, reversing, and then completing the turn.

### MPC Control Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 3,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 0.0,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 2.5,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Detailed Plan:

1. **Stop the Vehicle:**
   - **Behavior:** STOP
   - **Speed:** DECELERATION TO ZERO
   - **Summary:** Bring the vehicle to a complete stop before initiating the turn.

2. **Initiate Left Turn:**
   - **Behavior:** TURN LEFT
   - **Speed:** CONSTANT SPEED
   - **Summary:** Begin the left turn at a low constant speed, ensuring the turn angle is sufficient to clear the initial position.

3. **Reverse:**
   - **Behavior:** MOVE BACKWARD
   - **Speed:** CONSTANT SPEED
   - **Summary:** Reverse the vehicle to create enough space for the final turn.

4. **Complete the Turn:**
   - **Behavior:** TURN LEFT
   - **Speed:** CONSTANT SPEED
   - **Summary:** Complete the left turn and align the vehicle in the desired direction.

By following this plan, the ego vehicle will safely execute the left 3-point turn as instructed.
