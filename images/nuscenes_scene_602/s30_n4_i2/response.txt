### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 10 (Car):** Moving towards the ego vehicle in the left lane.
  - **ID 12 (Car):** Stationary in the right lane.
  - **ID 14 (Car):** Stationary in the left lane.
  - **ID 15 (Car):** Stationary in the right lane.
  - **ID 16 (Car):** Stationary in the left lane.
  - **ID 17 (Car):** Stationary in the right lane.
  - **ID 18 (Car):** Stationary in the right lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been relatively constant, with minor fluctuations.
- **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle has been decelerating slightly over the last 4 seconds.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been maintaining a nearly straight path.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** Initiate a 3-point turn to the left.

#### Speed:
- **Speed Adjustment:** Decelerate to zero to prepare for the 3-point turn.

#### Summary:
- **Overall Driving Plan:** 
  - Decelerate to a stop.
  - Turn the steering wheel fully to the left and move forward.
  - Reverse while turning the steering wheel fully to the right.
  - Move forward again while turning the steering wheel to the left to complete the 3-point turn.

### Detailed Steps for 3-Point Turn:
1. **Step 1: Decelerate to Zero**
   - **Behavior:** STOP
   - **Speed:** DECELERATION TO ZERO
   - **Yaw Rate:** 0 (straight)

2. **Step 2: Turn Left and Move Forward**
   - **Behavior:** TURN LEFT
   - **Speed:** ACCELERATION
   - **Yaw Rate:** 3 (sharp left turn)

3. **Step 3: Reverse and Turn Right**
   - **Behavior:** TURN RIGHT
   - **Speed:** REVERSE
   - **Yaw Rate:** -3 (sharp right turn)

4. **Step 4: Move Forward and Turn Left**
   - **Behavior:** TURN LEFT
   - **Speed:** ACCELERATION
   - **Yaw Rate:** 3 (sharp left turn)

By following these steps, the ego vehicle will successfully complete the 3-point turn while adhering to traffic rules and avoiding collisions with nearby objects.
