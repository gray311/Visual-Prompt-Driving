### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object IDs and Lanes:**
  - **ID 1 (Car)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **ID 3 (Car)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **ID 4 (Car)**: Parked on the right side of the road.
  - **ID 5 (Car)**: Parked on the left side of the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: Gradually increasing from 0.29 m/s to 2.22 m/s.
- **Acceleration**: Increasing from 0.49 m/s² to 1.53 m/s².
- **Turn Angle**: Increasing from 0.19 degrees to 44.96 degrees, indicating a left turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Action**: Perform a 3-point turn to the left.

#### Speed:
- **Adjustment**: Deceleration to zero, then controlled acceleration and deceleration during the turn.

#### Summary:
- **Overall Plan**: 
  1. Decelerate to a stop.
  2. Turn the steering wheel fully to the left and move forward.
  3. Reverse while turning the steering wheel to the right.
  4. Move forward again while turning the steering wheel to the left to complete the turn.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 1.5,
  "desired_headway": 1.5,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 5,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 1
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Fixed at 1 to maintain a balance between speed and control.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 3 for smoother control during the 3-point turn.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to ensure a safe distance from parked cars.
- **Desired Speed**: Set to 0 initially to stop the vehicle before starting the turn.
- **Desired Headway**: Set to 1.5 seconds to maintain a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: Set to 3 rad/s for the left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for smoother control during the turn.
