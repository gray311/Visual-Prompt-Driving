### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Objects Identified:**
  - **Car 8 and Car 9:** Located on the left side of the road, near the building.
  - **Car 10, Car 11, and Car 12:** Located further down the road, in the left lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle has been accelerating over the last 4 seconds, reaching a speed of 3.96 m/s.
- **Turn Angle:** The ego vehicle has been turning left, with the turn angle increasing from 119.7 degrees to 174.0 degrees.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior:** TURN LEFT
- **Speed:** DECELERATION TO ZERO

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle needs to perform a 3-point turn to the left as per the navigation command. The vehicle should decelerate to a stop, then execute the turn maneuver carefully, considering the nearby parked cars (Car 8 and Car 9) and the vehicles further down the road (Car 10, Car 11, and Car 12).

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 3,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 4,
  "desired_speed": 1,
  "desired_headway": 2,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 2.5,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 1 to maintain a balance between speed and control.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 3 for smoother control during the turn.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 4 to ensure a safe distance from nearby objects.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 0 to decelerate to a stop before executing the turn.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2 seconds to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 2.5 rad/s for a left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 3 for smoother control during the turn.
