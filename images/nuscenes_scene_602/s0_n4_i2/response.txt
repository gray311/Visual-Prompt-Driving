### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Object 1 (Car)**: Positioned on the right side, stationary.
- **Object 2 (Car)**: Positioned in the middle lane, stationary.
- **Object 3 (Car)**: Positioned on the right side, stationary.
- **Object 4 (Car)**: Positioned on the right side, stationary.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic light is visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating slightly from 0.0 m/s to 0.29 m/s over the past 4 seconds.
- **Turn Angle**: The ego vehicle has a slight turn angle of 0.19 degrees to the right.
- **Acceleration**: The ego vehicle has been accelerating at a consistent rate of approximately 0.49 m/sÂ².

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Behavior**: TURN LEFT
- **Speed**: DECELERATION TO ZERO (to prepare for the 3-point turn)

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle will decelerate to a stop and initiate a left 3-point turn. Given the stationary cars on the right side, the ego vehicle has enough space to execute the maneuver safely.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 3,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 1,
  "desired_headway": 0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 4.0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance)**: Fixed at 1 to maintain a balance between speed and control.
- **R (Control Effort)**: Set to 3 for moderate control effort, ensuring smooth maneuvering.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance)**: Set to 3 to maintain a safe distance from stationary objects.
- **Desired Speed**: 0.0 m/s to stop the vehicle before initiating the turn.
- **Desired Headway**: 2.0 seconds to ensure a safe distance from any potential moving objects.
- **Desired Yaw Rate**: 3.0 rad/s to execute the left turn.
- **Yaw Rate Weight**: Set to 3 for moderate control over the turning maneuver.
