### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Key Objects Identified:**
  - **Cars:**
    - ID 38: Parked on the left side.
    - ID 44: Parked on the left side.
    - ID 45: Parked on the right side.
    - ID 47: Parked on the right side.
    - ID 43: Parked on the right side.
    - ID 48: Parked on the left side.
    - ID 49: Parked on the left side.
    - ID 56: Parked on the right side.
  - **Lane Lines:**
    - ID 52, 53, 54, 55: Lane lines marking the road.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle's speed has been increasing over the last 4 seconds, from 4.11 m/s to 5.08 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The acceleration has been positive, indicating a gradual increase in speed.
- **Turn Angle:** The turn angle has been decreasing, indicating that the vehicle is straightening out from a turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward along the road, maintaining a constant speed. There are no immediate obstacles or traffic lights requiring a stop. The parked cars are not in the driving lane, so they do not pose a threat to the ego vehicle's path.

### MPC Signals:

{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 5.08,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,

}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** 5 (Moderate importance to maintain current speed)
- **R (Control Effort):** 0.1 (Low control effort for smoother driving)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** 3 (Moderate importance for safe following distance)
- **Desired Speed:** 5.08 m/s (Maintain current speed)
- **Desired Headway:** 2.0 seconds (Safe following distance)
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** 0 rad/s (No turning required)
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** 3 (Moderate weight for smooth control)
