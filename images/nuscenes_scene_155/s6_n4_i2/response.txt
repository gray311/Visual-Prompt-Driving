### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Cars:**
  - IDs: 11, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22
  - Lanes: All cars are parked along the sides of the road.
  - Movements: All cars are stationary.

- **Lane Lines:**
  - IDs: 16, 17, 23, 24
  - Positions: Lane lines are clearly marked on the road, indicating the boundaries of the driving lane.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** The ego vehicle has maintained a relatively constant speed around 6.9 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** The acceleration has been decreasing slightly over the last 4 seconds.
- **Turn Angle:** The turn angle has been increasing, indicating a slight leftward turn.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- The ego vehicle should continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. The surrounding vehicles are parked and do not pose an immediate threat. The lane lines are clearly marked, and the ego vehicle should stay within these boundaries. Given the slight leftward turn, the vehicle should adjust its steering slightly to the left to stay centered in the lane.

### MPC Signals:

```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 6.9,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0.1,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to ensure a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 6.9 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds for a safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0.1 rad/s for a slight leftward adjustment.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 2 for smoother control during the slight turn.
