### Grounded Reasoning:

#### Object Analysis:
- **Notable Objects:**
  - **Car 1:** In the right lane, stationary.
  - **Car 2:** In the right lane, stationary.
  - **Car 4:** In the right lane, stationary.
  - **Car 5:** In the left lane, stationary.
  - **Car 11:** In the left lane, moving forward.
  - **Car 12:** In the right lane, moving forward.
  - **Car 14:** In the left lane, moving forward.
  - **Car 15:** In the left lane, moving forward.
  - **Car 16:** In the left lane, moving forward.

#### Traffic Light:
- No traffic lights are visible in the provided frames.

#### Ego Analysis:
- **Speed:** Increasing from 4.08 m/s to 6.89 m/s.
- **Acceleration:** Positive, indicating increasing speed.
- **Turn Angle:** Slight variations, indicating minor adjustments in direction.

### High-Level Plan:

#### Behavior:
- **Planned Action:** MOVE FORWARD
- **Speed Adjustment:** CONSTANT SPEED

#### Summary:
- **Overall Driving Plan:** Continue moving forward while maintaining a constant speed. Be aware of the stationary cars in the right lane and the moving cars in the left lane. Ensure to stay in the current lane and avoid collisions.

### MPC Signals:
```json
{
  "Q": 5,
  "R": 0.1,
  "Q_h": 3,
  "desired_speed": 6.89,
  "desired_headway": 2.0,
  "desired_yaw_rate": 0,
  "yaw_rate_weight": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Q (Speed Maintenance):** Set to 5 to maintain the desired speed effectively.
- **R (Control Effort):** Set to 0.1 for smooth control adjustments.
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance):** Set to 3 to maintain a safe following distance.
- **Desired Speed:** Set to 6.89 m/s to maintain the current speed.
- **Desired Headway:** Set to 2.0 seconds for safe distance.
- **Desired Yaw Rate:** Set to 0 as the vehicle is moving straight.
- **Yaw Rate Weight:** Set to 2 for smoother control.
